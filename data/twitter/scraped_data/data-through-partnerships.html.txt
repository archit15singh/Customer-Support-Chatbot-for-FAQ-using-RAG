Additional information sharing with business partners
When X receives information about you, we use that information to improve our
services, to personalize your X experience, and for other purposes as described
in our  Privacy Policy.  In some cases, this involves sharing  non-public
personal information  with our partners.For the partnerships described below, we
provide you with additional control over whether your non-public personal data
may be shared if you are located in the specified regions.You can exercise this
control using the  Allow additional information sharing with business partners
setting in your   Personalization and Data  settings.  Changes to this setting
may not be immediate.The setting only applies to the particular types of
partnerships described below ââ it does not affect how X otherwise shares
data or through partnerships other than those described below.Additionally,
though these partnerships may operate globally, the setting only applies in the
specific regions as described below.This means that if a partnership is listed
as being subject to the setting in a select region, then only X customers in
that region can use the setting as described.For example, all X customers can
use the setting as described in the âsubject to the setting for all X
customers globallyâ section, but customers located in the EU, an EFTA state,
or the United Kingdom can also use the setting as described in the âsubject to
the setting for X customers located in the European Union, EFTA States, or the
United Kingdomâ section.     Partnerships, last updated April 6, 2020:
Subject to the setting for all X customers globally:       Other Advertising
Platforms Through Which X Markets Itself:   X shares certain non-public personal
information with certain digital advertising platforms to help measure and
optimize the effectiveness of our efforts to market X on those platforms.This
information can include IP address and mobile device advertising identifiers for
devices that open or log in to Xâs mobile apps; but does not include your
name, email, phone number, or X username.These advertising platform partners act
as data controllers for this information and the platforms we currently work
with in this capacity are:   Google [ Google's Privacy Policy ]     Facebook [
Facebookâs Data Policy ]   X may share this information with these partners
before youâve signed up for X (e.g.when you first open the app before creating
an account) as disclosed prior to download in the X app description in the App
Store and Google Play, but does not offer you control over this data sharing
until after youâve created a X account.Once youâve created a X account, if
your  Allow additional information sharing with business partners   setting is
disabled X will not thereafter share with these partners the non-public personal
information described above.Separately, you may be able to control how these
partners use this data by exercising privacy choices as described in their
privacy policies linked above.For X customers who signed up prior to the last
updated date above and who are located in the European Union, an EFTA State, or
the United Kingdom, X does not currently share this information with these
partners as described above even if your  Allow additional information sharing
with business partners   setting is enabled.            Subject to the setting
for X customers located in the European Union, EFTA States, or the United
Kingdom:       Mobile Application Advertising Campaign Information for Non-Data-
Processors:   X shares certain non-public personal information with advertisers
who run mobile application advertising campaigns through X.This information can
include which ads a particular browser or device saw, watched, or otherwise
interacted with; but does not include your name, email, phone number, or X
username.For example, X might share that a mobile device identifier viewed or
clicked on an ad for a particular mobile application.     X may share this
information directly with advertisers that are not acting as data processors,
but such advertisers more frequently access this data through data processor
partnerships.Data processors act on behalf of X to facilitate measurement and
analytics solutions for advertisers who run mobile application advertising
campaigns through X.If you are located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or
the United Kingdom, your  Allow additional information sharing with business
partners   setting must be enabled in order for X and its data processors to
share the non-public personal information described above with third parties
that are not acting as data processors.Share this article
