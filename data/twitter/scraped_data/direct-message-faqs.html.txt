Businesses and developers have the option to show you a welcome message when you
enter a new Direct Message conversation, which may include quick reply prompts
with specific instructions to help streamline your communication.The welcome
message you see may be tailored for you, including based on how you entered the
conversation.For example, if you click or tap on a link or button in a post to
go to Direct Messages, you may see a customized welcome message to continue the
topic or conversation.You might also see messages from businesses or developers
that appear different than most Direct Messages.This can include, but is not
limited to, messages with a list of predefined options for you to choose from. 
Note:  Businesses and developers will not know you saw their welcome message
unless you respond, and the fact that you saw the welcome message does not mean
the account can message you.Unless you have enabled the option to  Receive
Direct Messages from anyone, you must send them a message or follow them before
they can message you back.What happens when I am asked to mark media in Direct
Messages as âsharedâ?     Third-party apps may ask you for your consent to
configure media sent in Direct Messages as shareable.If media is configured as
shareable, it can be sent by the third-party app as part of multiple Direct
Message conversations between you and other people and will be viewable by
anyone with the mediaâs URL.How do I accept or delete incoming messages from
