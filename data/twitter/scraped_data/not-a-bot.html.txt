Not A Bot                                                        As of October
17th, 2023 weâve started testing âNot A Botâ, a new subscription method
for new users in two countries.This new test was developed to bolster our
already significant efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot
activity.This will evaluate a potentially powerful measure to help us combat
bots and spammers on X, while balancing platform accessibility with the small
fee amount.Within this test, existing users are not affected.     Hereâs how
this new test will work for  new accounts on web  in  New Zealand  and the
Philippines :        Step One: Phone Verification   New accounts created on X,
in these two countries, will first be required to verify their phone number.Step
Two: Select Your Subscription Plan   $1 USD Annual Fee (prices vary by country
and currency).New users will be able to perform certain actions on the web
version of the platform: post content, Like posts, Reply, Repost and Quote other
accountsâ posts, Bookmark posts.X Premium   Verified Organizations       
New users who opt out of subscribing will only be able to take âread onlyâ
actions, such as: Read posts, Watch videos, and Follow accounts.This new program
aims to defend against bots and spammers who attempt to manipulate the platform
and disrupt the experience of other X users.We look forward to sharing more
about the results soon.     Pricing   New Zealand: $1.43 NZD per year  
Philippines: â±42.51 PHP per year     Note: Users who participate in the Not-A-
Bot program are subject to the  Not a Bot Terms and Conditions.
