Post location FAQs                                Below are some answers to
common questions regarding posting with your location.Learn about how to   post
with your location.What location information is attached to my posts?      
Enabling precise location allows you to selectively add location information to
your posts.This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it.
 This allows X to collect, store, and use your precise location, such as GPS
information.Once you've  enabled precise location , you will be able to attach a
location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your post.Simply tap
the location marker while composing your post, and select the location you wish
to tag.Note:  Once you post with a location, your next post will automatically
include a general location label.Learn how to  turn location off  at any
time.Third-party applications or websites may let you post with location,
including your precise location.We ask these developers to clearly explain what
information is being shared when you use their products to post with location. 
    What controls do I have when I attach location information to my posts?
   Even after you enable posting with your location, you have additional control
over which posts (and what type of location information) is shared.With this in
mind:   post location is  off by default , and you will need to  opt in  to the
service.You can turn post location on or off at any time.   You can  delete your
past location data from displaying in your posts  in a single place (see this
article  for step-by-step instructions).Be cautious and careful about the amount
of information you share online.There may be some updates where you want to
share your location ("The parade is starting now" or "A truck just spilled
delicious candy all over the roadway!"), and some updates where you want to keep
your location private.Just like you might not want to post your home address,
please be cautious when posting from locations that you don't want others to
see.Remember that when you're opted into post location, suggested locations may
be offered to you, but you can still choose  not  to share your location for
individual posts (see this  article  for instructions).Please familiarize
yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications
and devices you post with so that you are always aware of the information you
share.Remember, once you post something online, itâs out there for others to
see.     What location information is displayed?         All geolocation
information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your
browser or device.X won't show any location information unless  you've  opted in
to the feature , and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your
coordinates to us.If you have chosen to attach location information to your
posts, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the
post.On x.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a
neighborhood or city.When you use the in-app camera on X for iOS and Android to
attach a photo or video to your post  and toggle on the option to tag your
precise location, that post will include both the location label of your choice
and your device's precise location (latitude and longitude), which can be found
via API.Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you
select.  This is helpful when sharing on-the-ground moments.Note:   The option
to share your precise location from the in-app camera is currently available
only on newer versions of X for iOS (6.26 or later) and on newer versions of X
for Android (version 5.55 or later).   Application developers are required to be
up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place,
will be included in your post.When you post from a third-party application or
mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be included in your
post.Note:  In some areas, you have the option to label your post with a
specific business, landmark, or point of interest.These places are sourced from
Foursquare.If you see an issue with a place, please report it via
Foursquareâs Help Center.If you believe that a specific post is abusive,
please report it to X.Share this article                                    Post
