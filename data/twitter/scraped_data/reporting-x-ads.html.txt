How to report X Ads                                                        Make
sure itâs a X Ad.     X Ads are paid promotions that brands use to amplify
messages, target potential customers, and grow their follower bases.X Ads are
identified by a pill listing the name of the advertiser or political advertiser,
and designates the content as an ad.X Ads are not the same as a post from an
account for a brand or business, or a post that includes âadâ or
âsponsoredâ in the post text.For more information, please see:   What are
Promoted posts?   What are Promoted Trends?             Take steps that can
immediately resolve the issue.Note:  Consider saving relevant information, such
as the   postâs URL , if you think you may need to reference a post at a later
point.Dismiss the post: If you see a Promoted post that you no longer want to
see, you can dismiss it to remove it right away.This action provides X with
feedback about the advertiser and prevents that particular Promoted post from
appearing in your timeline again.To read more about dismissing Promoted posts, 
see here.Contact the advertiser: Promoted posts are posts first, which means you
can interact with them exactly as you would any other post.You may want to reply
to the advertiser or, if the advertiser follows you, send them a Direct Message
to bring any issues directly to their attention.Block the advertiser: Blocking
an advertising account will prevent its Promoted posts from appearing in your
timeline going forward.It will also prevent the account from being displayed as
a recommended Promoted Account.To read more about what blocking does on X,   see
here.     Report the X Ad.X has a form for reports related to X Ads.Although
advertisers are responsible for the content of their profile, posts and all
promotions they run on the X Ads platform, we will examine reported violations
of the  X Ads Policy , the  X Rules  and  Terms of Service  and will take action
accordingly.     You can report X Ads  here.Share this article
