About measuring sales impact
How we measure the effectiveness of posts from brands     We measure the
performance of brands' posts (both Promoted and organic) to help them provide
high-quality ads and content that is more interesting to you.We may work with ad
partners to help measure the impact of such ads and content based on information
they have about in-store sales.We hope that this helps increase the usefulness
of brands' posts for you.Let's say a food brand would like to know how its posts
impact sales of its ice cream in stores.We've designed a process to measure this
offline sales impact while protecting user privacy.Here's how it works:     Our
measurement partners send us a list of browser cookies IDs and/or unreadable
scrambled (hashed) email addresses, mobile device IDs, and phone numbers, along
with corresponding ID numbers that we then match to corresponding information
that our users have associated with their X accounts.When there's a match, we
share with our measurement partner only the matched ID number and information
about activity on X, like views of and clicks on the food brand's posts.Then our
partner can measure the offline sales impact by comparing the ice cream
purchases of users shown the brand's content on X with those who were not.Our
partner includes the aggregated results of its analysis in a report for the
brand.     Measurement with privacy in mind     We have taken extra steps to
respect privacy in our measurement process, including hiring a top-tier
consulting firm to perform an independent review of the privacy practices of
Datalogix, the first partner that X worked with to measure offline sales
impact.The firm confirmed that:   Datalogix never sends X information about
individual users' purchases.The reports that Datalogix creates for advertisers
include only aggregated information.The reports have minimum group sizes that
are large enough that they do not reveal individual users' purchases.Datalogix
segregates the information it receives from X and does not incorporate it into
its existing data sets about individual users.Share this article
