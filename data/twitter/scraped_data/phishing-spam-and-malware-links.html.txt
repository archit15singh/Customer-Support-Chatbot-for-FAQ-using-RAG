Our approach to blocking links
Overview     July 2020   At times, X will take action to limit or prevent the
spread of URL links to content outside X.This is done by displaying a warning
notice when the link is clicked, or by blocking the link so that it canât be
posted at all.We may take action to limit the spread of the following categories
of links:   Malicious links that could steal personal information or harm
electronic devices.This includes:   Links that contain or lead to malware
Attempts at phishing        Spammy links that mislead people or disrupt their
experience.This includes:   Malicious redirected links that send people to an
unexpected destination Links associated with known platform manipulation
campaigns URL shorteners that are primarily used to mislead or deceive people
about the websiteâs content.   Otherwise misleading or deceptive links; e.g.,
malicious affiliate links and clickjacking links          Find out more about
our  platform manipulation and spam policy.     Certain categories of content
that, if posted directly on X, would violate our rules.This includes links to
websites that feature:     Terrorism and violent extremism Media, or other
content created by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups
Recruitment sites for a terrorist organization or violent extremist group    
Child sexual exploitation (CSE) Media depicting CSE Identification of child
survivors of sexual abuse        Illegal or certain regulated goods or services
Offers to buy, sell, or facilitate transactions in illegal goods or services, as
well as certain types of regulated goods or services        Hateful conduct
Content that promotes violence against, threatens or harasses other people on
the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation,
gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious
disease        Violence    Content that threatens violence against an individual
or a group of people, or glorifies violence where people were targeted because
of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts    
Private information Other people's private information that was posted without
their express authorization and permission          Non-consensual nudity
Intimate media of someone that was shared without their consent        Content
that interferes with  civic and election integrity Misleading information about
how to vote or register to vote        Hacked material Content obtained through
hacking that contains private information, may put people in physical harm or
danger, or contains trade secrets          Violent or misleading content that
could lead to real-world harm in the aftermath of a crisis incident.This
includes, but is not limited to, links to websites that contain:   Manifestos
associated with violent incidents Media that depicts acts associated with a
violent incident          How we surface links     We use a combination of
factors to identify links that we may ultimately take enforcement action
against.We receive information about links from many sources, including:
Third-party vendors who specialize in countering spam and malware Collaborative
information sharing with industry peers and trusted NGO partners Internal
technology and tools Reported posts        Our enforcement options       We
consider several factors when deciding whether to introduce a warning notice to
a link, or to prevent it from being shared on X.These considerations include:
The source of the URL in question and our degree of certainty that the link is
malicious or harmful.For example: Links reviewed by X may be blocked outright,
whereas a warning notice may be applied to links we first become aware of via
lower-confidence information sharing from trusted third parties        The
severity of the websiteâs content      Context and apparent intent of the link
sharer.For instance: We may treat newsworthy links shared by journalists
differently than if the link were shared by someone else We may treat links to
websites criticizing or commenting on content that violates our rules
differently than links sharing the content straightforwardly or without
commentary We may treat links with commentary glorifying a violent incident
differently than links expressing outrage about the same incident     
Accounts dedicated to sharing content which we block, or which attempt to
circumvent a block on the sharing a link, may be subject to additional
enforcement action, including suspension.Learn more about  our range of
enforcement options.In some cases, the sharing of a link will also result in
account suspension due to a zero-tolerance policy (for instance, if a link is
shared to child sexual exploitation content).About blocked links   If we have
blocked a link, you will see an error message if you try to include it in your
post or Direct Message, or on your profile.The message reads: âYou canât
complete this action because this link has been identified by X or our partners
as being potentially harmful.Please visit our Help Center to learn more.â    
About links that have warning notices   In some instances, X will introduce a
warning that the link may be unsafe.The warning notice can be clicked through if
you wish to proceed to the third-party site.When a link has been categorized by
X as meeting the criteria for a warning notice, it will also have limited
visibility on X.Read more about  limited post visibility.     Miscategorized
links       We work at a rapid pace and in collaboration with third parties to
stay on top of emerging malicious or harmful links.Sometimes, despite our best
efforts, links can be miscategorized.If you notice that a link has been blocked
or has a warning notice and you believe this is in error, you can report it to
us via  this form.In the âproblematic linkâ field, please insert the
extended URL of the link, rather than a shortened version.Share this article
