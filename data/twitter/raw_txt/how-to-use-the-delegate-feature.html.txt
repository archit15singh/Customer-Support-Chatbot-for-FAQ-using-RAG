How to use the Delegate feature
X Delegate is a feature that allows multiple users to better collaborate on a
single X account.Now you can securely manage whoâs contributing to an account,
and assign or remove rolesâwithout sharing passwords.Delegate is available on
X.com and X Pro, but you need to enable Delegate and invite collaborators on
X.com.          Why should I use X Delegate?   Now you can better collaborate
with other users contributing to a single X account:     Assign or remove roles
and permissions: Designate admin and contributor roles (with predefined
permissions) for a single account.Easily switch between accounts: Switch between
your owned and delegated accounts, and take actions on behalf of your accounts.
   Collaborate without sharing passwords: Safely delegate permissions for an
account without the hassle of sharing passwords.     How does X Delegate work?
You can invite other users to act on behalf of a single account, and accept such
invites, via  Delegate  on x.com.Invites can be for either an admin or
contributor role.Based on the role accepted, delegates will have different
permissions:        Owner   Can manage password, phone number, and login
verification settings.Can invite others to access the account as admins or
contributors.Can take action on behalf of the team account ( post ,  repost ,
Direct Message ,  like , etc.), schedule posts, delete posts, and create lists.
     Admin   Can invite others to access the account as admins or
contributors.Can take action on behalf of the delegate account (post, repost,
Direct Message, like, etc.), schedule posts, delete posts, create lists, and
build collections.Can view post analytics.       Contributor   Can take action
on behalf of the delegated account (post, repost, Direct Message, like, etc.),
schedule posts, delete posts, create lists, and build collections.Note: Account
owners are responsible for the content posted to their accounts by authorized
admins and contributors.How do I use X Delegate?                    Sharing
access to an account                    To set up delegates:   Log in to X.com
with the account you wish to delegate a role to.Click Your account in the
navigation bar.Select Security and account access, then X Delegate, then Invite
a member.Type the name or @username of the person youâd like to invite in the
Invite a member to this account field.Assign a role to the member by selecting
either contributor or admin.Click Send invite.Once you have invited someone,
theyâll receive an email, and an invitation in  Delegate  on x.com.The new
delegate will need to accept the invitation to begin using the shared
account.Managing Delegates                    Only the owner of the delegated
account manages the password, phone number, and login verification settings.Both
owners and admins can manage delegates on the account.     To change a role or
remove a delegate:   Log in to X.com with the account you wish to delegate a
role to.Click Your account in the navigation bar.Select Security and account
access, then X Delegate, then Members youâve delegated to.Find the account
that youâd like to change the role for and click Change role or Remove from
account.Confirm your selection.     Note: contributors do not have the ability
to manage delegated accounts.Only admins can manage the team.Managing your
Delegations                    When youâre invited to accept a delegated role,
youâll receive an email notification as well as a notification in  Delegate
on x.com.If you no longer wish to have a delegated role on an account you can
remove that delegation.     To manage a accept or decline a delegate invite:
From  Delegate  on x.com: Click Accounts delegated to you.Under Pending invites
 youâll see the X account that youâve been invited to join.Click Accept
(tick) or Decline (cross).If you accept, that account will now be shown under
admin access or contributor access based on the role accepted.     To remove
yourself from delegated role:   From  Delegate  on x.com:     Select the account
for which you wish to remove your delegation.Click Leave account.Confirm your
selection by clicking Leave.I donât want to be invited to have any
delegations.How can I change my settings?   You can change your settings to
adjust if you can receive invites to accept a delegated role.From  Delegate  on
x.com: turn off Allow others to Delegate to you.     What will happen to my
delegates if I change the password for my X account?   Your delegates wonât
lose access to the account if you change the password.We encourage you to update
the password so that only you (as the owner, or person who manages the account)
knows it.     Iâm not able to invite a particular person to be a delegate.What
should I do?   The person may have settings enabled that prevents them from
being invited to receive a delegation.Talk to the person to check whether this
is the case.Share this article                                    Post
