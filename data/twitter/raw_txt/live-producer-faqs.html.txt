using LiveCut - FAQs         What is the video quality of the clips?        If
your original broadcast resolution is lower than 1280x720, your clips will adopt
your original resolution size.If your broadcast resolution is 1280x720 or
higher, all clips will be limited to a resolution size of 1280x720.     Are
captions included in LiveCut clips?     We allow pass-through of both EIA-608
and 708 captions from the broadcast.These will not be visible while editing in
LiveCut, but will be included in any clips created from a broadcast with these
embedded captions.Once a clip is posted, it will be available in the Library tab
of Media Studio.Within your Library you can also add a.srt subtitle file to the
posted video.          Will any of the broadcast settings be applied to clips
created from that broadcast?     Clips created in LiveCut will automatically
have the same category and geo-restrictions settings, if used.     Can multiple
users create clips within LiveCut at the same time?     Yes, many users can work
within LiveCut together to clip, edit, and post video clips.Users working
together in the same broadcast should occasionally refresh their browser to
ensure they see the most up-to-date list of created clips.     Why canât I
clip from a broadcast?     This could be for one of three reasons:   Ensure that
the broadcast has video content.You cannot clip from broadcasts that have not
yet happened, or did not have video on the source when live.Ensure that âMake
broadcast replay unavailableâ is unchecked in broadcast details.Either clip
while the broadcast is live or at any time before the replay is made
unavailable, or create a second âPrivateâ broadcast using a different source
which can be used for clipping.Long broadcasts may cause issues within LiveCut;
it is recommended that you not clip from broadcasts longer than 12 hours in
length.     Are the clips made in the LiveCut frame accurate?     The LiveCut
editor is not frame-accurate, and it is not unexpected to have your selected
start or end points displaced by a few frames.          Why are my broadcasts
and clips appearing pixelated in LiveCut, but my posts are not?       This is
usually due to certain GOP settings on the sending encoder.We recommend using
âClosed GOPsâ.On some encoders this may be named âForced IDRâ.        
How can I make a GIF in LiveCut?       It is not possible to make a GIF in
LiveCut, though X automatically loops posted videos that are under 1 minute in
length.     How do I delete a clip that Iâve created in LiveCut?     A clip
that has not been posted can easily be deleted via the Clips list within
LiveCut.A clip that has been posted should be deleted in your Library in Media
Studio.Deleting a posted clip from the Clips list in LiveCut will not delete the
video that is live on X in your post.     Are there keyboard shortcuts I can use
for clipping in LiveCut?     Yes, a list of keyboard shortcuts can be found
within LiveCut by clicking the information link at the bottom left corner of the
LiveCut window.These are the keyboard shortcuts:   PLAY/PAUSE video = SPACE BAR
Set START point (in) = I   Set END point (out) = O   Focus controls on START
point (in) = S   Focus controls on END point (out) = E   PLAY from start of clip
= P   PLAY last two seconds of clip = L   Go BACK one frame =    Go BACK one
second = SHIFT   Go FORWARD one frame =    Go FORWARD one second = SHIFT   OPEN
keyboard shortcuts menu = ?           Creating clips using LiveCut - Common
errors and warnings        Error: âUpload failedâ   This occasionally occurs
when attempting to create a clip.Occasional clip failures are not unexpected for
LiveCut.Reasons for this may be due to volume of clips being created within your
account, reduced internet connectivity in your area, times of heavy traffic, or
other transient issues.     Sometimes attempting to re-create the media
altogether, or modifying it slightly, allows the clip to be created
successfully.To modify a failed clip:     Click on it in the Clips list within
LiveCut Click 'Edit media' and then edit the start or end time of your clip by a
few frames Click 'Save' and then see if the clip gets created successfully

post.Posting from LiveCut - FAQs        Why can I not post out my clip?
Clips must finish processing before they can be posted.There is a processing
wheel in the upper right corner of the clip thumbnail that fills in as the clip
is being processed and disappears once processing is complete.     How long
should I expect a clip to process before I can post it?     Clips can take up to
half as long as the clip duration to process, after which they will be available
to post.For example, a clip that is a minute long may take up to 30 seconds to
complete processing.     Can I edit a clip once Iâve created or posted it?
You are able to make edits to a video clip at any point after creating it in
LiveCut.However once you have posted the clip, any new edits to the start or end
point will result in a new copy of the clip added to your Clips list.The
original posted clip will not be updated with your changes, and the new copy of
the clip will not have saved any of the original clipâs metadata.          Can
I edit a clipâs metadata in LiveCut after Iâve posted it?     Modifications
to geo-restrictions and subtitles settings will be applied to all posts in which
the media is shared on X, even retroactively.However, title, description,
category, call-to-action, and embedding settings cannot be changed for an
existing post -- any changes made to these settings will be reflected in any new
posts created with that media.Share this article
