About public and protected Posts
                             Your browser does not support the
<code>video</code> element.What is the difference between public and protected
posts?        When you sign up for X, your posts are public by default; anyone
can view and interact with your posts.Should you choose to protect your posts,
you can do so through your  account settings.Learn more  protecting your posts.
 If you protect your posts, youâll receive a request when new people want to
follow you, which you can approve or deny.Accounts that began following you
before you protected your posts will still be able to view and interact with
your protected posts unless you block them.Learn more about  blocking.     Who
can see my posts?        Public posts   (the default setting): Are visible to
anyone, whether or not they have a X account.Protected posts :  Only visible to
your X followers.Please keep in mind, your followers may still capture images of
your posts and share them.Note:  If you have authorized a third-party
application to access your account, that  third-party application  may be able
to see your protected posts.Keep in mind that when you choose to share content
on X with others, this content may be downloaded or shared.When you protect your
posts        Youâll receive a request when new people want to follow you,
which you can  approve or deny.Your posts, including  permanent links to your
posts , will only be visible to your followers.Your followers will not be able
to use the  repost  icon   to  repost or repost with comment.Protected posts
will not appear in third-party search engines (like Google search).Your
protected posts will only be searchable on X by you and your followers.Replies
you send to an account that isnât following you will not be seen by that
account (because only your followers will see your posts).Note:  When you share
a link in a protected post, it is automatically processed and shortened to an
http://t.co   link.Please note that anyone with a   t.co shortened link   will
be able to navigate to the destination URL.What happens when I change my posts
from public to protected?       If you at one time had public posts (before
protecting your posts), those posts will no longer be public on X, or appear in
public X search results.Instead, your posts will only be viewable and searchable
on X by you and your followers.Note:   posts sent before you changed your
settings to  Protect your posts  may still be seen by someone who had the post
on their Home timeline before the change.However, they wonât be able to
interact with the post or see its details.What happens when I change my posts
from protected to public?       Unprotecting your posts will cause any
previously protected posts to be made public.     What happens when I share
media in a protected post?     If your posts are protected, only your followers
will be able to see your media in your posts.Please note that your followers may
download or re-share links to media that you share in protected posts.Links to
media shared on X are not protected.Anyone with the link will be able to view
the content.     What happens when my posts are protected but still show in
search engine results?        After you protect your posts, only you and your
followers can read your updates or see your posts in X search.If you at one time
had public posts (before protecting your posts), those posts will no longer be
public or appear in public X search results, unless someone  had the post added
to their Home timeline before you changed your settings to  Protect your posts.*
However, unprotecting your posts will cause any previously protected posts to be
made public.Find out how to remove your updates from Google search.X does not
have the ability to remove content on websites other than X.com.     What If my
posts have never been public?        If your posts have never been public (i.e.,
you've always had your posts protected in your settings), your updates should
never show up in X search or other public search engines.If they are showing up
in search results, change your password immediately and revoke untrusted third-
party applications.You can also file a report with the following information:
