Counterfeit policy                                X prohibits the sale of or
promoting the sale of counterfeit goods on the platform. 
What are counterfeit goods?       Counterfeit goods are goods, including digital
goods, that are promoted, sold, or otherwise distributed using a trademark or
brand that is identical to, or substantially indistinguishable from, the
registered trademark or brand of another, without authorization from the
trademark or brand owner.Counterfeit goods attempt to deceive consumers into
believing the counterfeit is a genuine product of the brand owner, or to
represent themselves as faux, replicas or imitations of the genuine product. 
    How is this policy different from Xâs trademark policy?     Xâs
trademark policy applies to uses of trademarks that may mislead or confuse
others about oneâs brand affiliation, other than sale or promotion of
counterfeit goods.Xâs counterfeit policy applies to the sale or promotion of
counterfeit goods.     What is a violation of Xâs counterfeit policy?
