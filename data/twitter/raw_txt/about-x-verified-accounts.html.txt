How to get the blue checkmark on X
What does the blue checkmark mean?                          The blue checkmark
means that the account has an active subscription to  X Premium   and meets our
eligibility requirements.Starting April 1, 2023 we began winding down our legacy
Verification program and accounts that were verified under the previous criteria
(active, notable, and authentic) will not retain a blue checkmark unless they
are subscribed to X Premium.Subscribers will need to meet our eligibility
criteria below to receive or retain the blue checkmark.Eligibility criteria for
the blue checkmark                          Only accounts actively subscribed to
X Premium are eligible to receive the blue checkmark.Our team uses an
eligibility criteria on when the checkmark is given to ensure we maintain the
integrity of the platform.Your account must meet the following criteria to
receive or retain the blue checkmark:     Complete:  Your account must have a
display name and profile photo   Active use:  Your account must be active in the
past 30 days to subscribe to X Premium   Security: Your account must have a
confirmed phone number   Non-Deceptive:   Your account must have no recent
changes to your profile photo, display name, or username (@handle)   Your
account must have no signs of being  misleading or deceptive   Your account must
have no signs of engaging in  platform manipulation and spam            The
checkmark will appear once our team reviews your Premium subscribed account and
if it meets our requirements.As a result of this change, X will no longer be
accepting applications for the blue Verification checkmarks under the previous
criteria  (active, notable, and authentic).Loss of the blue checkmark
In accordance with the  Terms of Service , including our  Purchaser terms , X
may remove the checkmark of an account at any time without notice.          To
minimize confusion and promote integrity on the platform, changes to your
profile photo, display name, or username (@handle) will result in a temporary
loss of the blue checkmark until your account is validated as continuing to meet
our requirements.No further changes to your profile photo, display name, or
username will be allowed during this review period.     The checkmark will
appear again once our team reviews your X Premium subscribed account and if it
continues to meet our requirements.     X may also remove the checkmark from
accounts that are found to be in violation of the X Rules.     You may not
purchase X Premium if you are a person with whom X is not permitted to have
dealings under US and any other applicable economic sanctions and trade
compliance law.     Any violation of the X Terms of Service or X Rules,
manipulation of X processes, or circumvention of enforcement actions may result
in the loss of the checkmark or in certain instances, suspension.Share this
