Help with email address confirmation
When you add or change the email address attached to your account, weâll send
you an email asking you to confirm the change.In the email we send, clicking the
Confirm now  button lets us know the email address is yours. 
I never received a confirmation email from X                    If you never
received an email from us, thereâs a few places the email may have landed:
Spam, junk, and bulk mail folders : Sometimes our emails are blocked or filtered
as spam by certain email providers or internet service providers (ISPs), so take
a look in your spam, junk or bulk folders.Filters and tabs : Calling all Gmail
users! if you havenât already, be sure to take a look at your  Social tab  for
emails from X.I got the email, but the button wonât work     If you received
the email but are having trouble confirming your email address, try these steps:
Log in to your account : You can log in before you click the  Confirm now
button, or weâll ask you to log in after you click it.Either way, weâll ask
you to log in so we can complete the confirmation.Resend your confirmation email
: The  Confirm now  link we sent you may be expired (we do this for security
reasons), but we can send you a new one.To request a new email, log in to your X
account.At the top of your account screen, look for the yellow prompt.Click the
Resend confirmation  button and check your email again.     Nothing is working
If youâve tried resending the email and you are still having trouble, here are
some troubleshooting tips:   Are we sending it to the wrong email address?
Double check your  Account settings  to make sure your email is entered
accurately.See any typos? Do we have an old email on file? Make any necessary
corrections and click save; weâll send another email if youâve updated the
address.Try changing the email address to an email address with a large domain
(Gmail, Yahoo, etc.).We tend to have more success delivering emails to those
types of domains.Still need help?  Contact us.Share this article
