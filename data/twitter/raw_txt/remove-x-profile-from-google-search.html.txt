Controlling how your X information appears in Google search
Skip to main content                                  Help Center
Help with Google search visibility                                Keep in mind
that the words you write in your X profile or public posts may be indexed by
Google and other search engines, and cause your profile or posts to come up in a
search for those terms.Depending on the degree to which this concerns you, you
can try one or more of the steps below to prevent certain information from
displaying in third party search results:     Change your name  as it appears in
your profile Change your username Protect your posts           Note:   Third-
party search engines like Google use many factors to generate search results,
like the content of public posts and X profiles, or blogs and other websites
that link to posts or X profiles.X does not control search results on third
party search engines.Why are my posts appearing on Google after deleting or
protecting them?        Protected posts:   Public posts posted before you enable
the setting to protect your posts may still be indexed in a third-party search
engine.Once you have saved your account settings to protect your posts, the
posts you post thereafter will be protected.If you later change your account
settings to no longer protect your posts, posts that were previously protected
will become public and may be indexed by third-party search engines.     Deleted
posts:   Even if you delete posts, Google and other search engines cache search
results, which means that occasionally old information is still searchable
 until Google and other search engines update their systems to reflect more
recent information.Any old links appearing in a Google search will lead to X's
error page: "That page doesn't exist!" The old links still appear because Google
and other search engines may not have the current information updated in their
search index.How and when to send Google a request to remove information
Google will eventually index updated X information, but if you'd like to request
Google to do it sooner, follow these steps:   Copy the X URL you'd like removed
from Google's index (for example: X.com/#!/[username here]/status/12345678)
Visit Google's page to  remove outdated content.Paste in the X URL that you'd
like removed.Submit your request.Note:   You may be required to log in to your
Google account to complete the steps above.If you don't have one, you may need
to create one.Read more about  removing your content from Google's search
index.Share this article                                    Post
