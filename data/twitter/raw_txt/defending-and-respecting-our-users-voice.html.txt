Defending and respecting the rights of people using our service
Defending and respecting the userâs voice is one of our core values at X.This
value is a two-part commitment to freedom of expression and privacy.Transparency
is also an important part of this commitment.In that spirit, X wants to publicly
share how we translate this core value into our decision-making.X employees
across the company consider our core values everyday in all aspects of their
work, from product design to how we handle legal requests for account
information and beyond.This starts on day one at X with new hire orientation and
is reinforced continually in our internal and external communications, as well
as our actions.This is core to our product and our company at every level
including our executive team and board of directors.This is a global commitment,
and while grounded in the United States  Bill of Rights  and the  European
Convention on Human Rights , it is informed by a number of additional sources
including the members of our  Trust and Safety Council , relationships with
advocates and activists around the globe, and by works such as  United Nations
Principles on Business and Human Rights.Some examples of steps we take to defend
and respect our users include: ¹     Our  transparency report  â published bi-
annually since 2012;     Our  user notice  policies; Challenges to court orders
to remove content from our platform or disclose user data; Providing  in service
notices  when content is removed or withheld or accounts suspended;   Working
with groups and coalitions, in the U.S.and globally, to support legal changes
that enhance user privacy or to fight laws and legal decisions which threaten to
chill speech and undermine privacy; Giving people  access to their account
information ; Publishing a range of resources for people and organizations using
our service, the public and  law enforcement Sharing  clear guidelines  about
appropriate uses of Xâs Public APIs and Gnip data products     While this is a
whole company effort, we also have a Trust and Safety team whose mandate is the
protection of the people and organizations using our service and building trust
in X.This is their full-time job and it has been since the team was created in
2008.Our Trust and Safety team plays a key role in decisionmaking in the
company.The team helps the company understand the impact certain decisions may
have on the people and organizations using our service, for example: entering
new markets; releasing new product features; changing our Terms of Service,
Privacy Policy and X Rules; facilitating acquisitions and integrations with X;
and developing new policies for content on the platform.Trust and Safety,
reporting to our General Counsel, is a key partner for stakeholders across the
company and works in tandem with product, engineering, user services, sales,
public policy, and legal to help X keep the people and organizations using our
service front and center when we make
decisions.____________________________________    ¹ Detailed examples are
regularly included in the explanatory text of our Transparency Reports.Share
