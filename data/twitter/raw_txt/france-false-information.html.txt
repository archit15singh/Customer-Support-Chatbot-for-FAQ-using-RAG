Reporting false information in France
You can report two types of false information to X.          False information
about voting or registering to vote        The  X Rules  prohibit posting
content that provides false information about voting or registering to vote. 
If you report this type of content, we will review the reported post.If we
determine that the post is in violation of our policies, we will take action
(ranging from requiring the removal of the prohibited content to permanently
suspending the account).You will receive a follow up from us if we need more
information from you, or when we take action on the reported post.       
False information that could alter the voteâs sincerity or disturb the public
order        French law requires that we also provide a means for you to report
false information that could alter the voteâs sincerity or disturb the public
order.     We do not review or take action on these reports on an individual
basis.However, we use these reports to inform how we defend our platform against
manipulation.Share this article                                    Post
