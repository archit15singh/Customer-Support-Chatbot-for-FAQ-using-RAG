About X's account suggestions
How does X find accounts to suggest?       Xâs account suggestions are based
on algorithms that make personalized suggestions for you.You may see suggestions
based on criterion such as:   If youâve uploaded your contacts to X, weâll
suggest you connect with those who already have X accounts.If someone has
uploaded their contacts to X, and your email address or phone number is included
in their contacts, we may suggest you follow them.X may also make suggestions
based on your location, such as the city or country you are in.We may make
suggestions based on your activity on X, such as your posts, who you follow, and
accounts and posts that you view or otherwise interact with.If your settings
permit, we may make personalized suggestions based on your visits to third-party
websites that integrate X content.Learn more.X may include Promoted Accounts as
suggestions for accounts for you to follow.Read more about Promoted Accounts
