About email addresses
Your email account is directly related to your X account.You should use a secure
and private email address to associate with your X account.If you forget your X
password, instructions for resetting it can be emailed to your email address
upon request.If you do not have a secure email account, you do not have a secure
X account.                      Email security checklist                    Use
a strong, unique password and keep it safe.When you set up your account, be sure
to choose a strong password (at least 10 characters that include upper and lower
case characters, numbers, and symbols).Do not share your password with anyone.No
matter how strong your password is, if someone else knows it, itâs no longer
secure.Do not use the same password on multiple sites or for multiple accounts
on the same site.One compromise can lead to many others.Do not use the same
password for your email and X account.     Use a password management system that
will generate and store strong passwords for you.Both 1password and Lastpass are
good options.Learn more         For more information, you can visit the
