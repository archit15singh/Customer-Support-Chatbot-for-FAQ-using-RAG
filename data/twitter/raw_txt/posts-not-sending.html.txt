seeing an error message after posting a post        If you see a "Whoops, you
already said that" error message when you post a post, you've posted the exact
same text in another post recently, and should try writing something new in your
next post.You should only see this error if you post  exactly  the same text as
a recent post.     What should I do?     Try posting a different post.If you
never post the exact same text in posts you'll never get this error.     Iâm
