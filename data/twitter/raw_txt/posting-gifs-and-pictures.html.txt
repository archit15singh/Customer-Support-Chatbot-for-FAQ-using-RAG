photo?     When location services are enabled, and you attach a photo in the
composer, X refers to the Exif data of the photo to show suggested locations. 
In addition, X uses Exif data for analytics purposes related to whether posted
media was taken with the device camera.       X retains Exif data temporarily to
process your photo.It is not available to those who view your photo on X.Will

X search results.Photos posted in protected Posts and deleted photos will not
show up in X search results.Can I share videos on X?     Yes, it's easy to  
share and watch videos on X.Why do I sometimes not have the option to search for
a GIF in my X app?     Depending on your mobile connection, searching for a GIF

through the media library, you can still upload a GIF that is saved to your
phoneâs photo library.Need more help?   If you have more questions about
