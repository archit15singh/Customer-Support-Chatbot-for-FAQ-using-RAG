About replies and mentions                                You can join
conversations on X by replying to others and by mentioning them in your own
posts.Reply overview        A reply is a response to another personâs post.You
can reply by clicking or tapping the  reply  icon          from a post.When you
reply to someone else, your post will show the message  Replying to...when
viewed in your profile page timeline.When someone replies to one of your posts
you will see  Replying to you  above the post and you will receive a
notification in your Notifications tab.When two people are replying to one
another, only relevant people, such as those who follow the person who replied
and the person in the conversation, will see the reply in their timeline.If you
click or tap on a reply in your timeline, it will expand to display the post
that was replied to.Replies from people with protected posts will only be
visible to their followers.If someone sends you a reply and you are not
following them, the reply will not appear in your Home timeline.Instead, the
reply will appear in your Notifications tab.Sometimes, replies in a conversation
are not shown in chronological order.We strive to show you the content that we
think youâd be most interested in and contributes to the conversation in a
meaningful way, such as content that is relevant, credible, and safe.When
ranking a reply higher, we consider factors such as if the original post author
has replied, if a reply is from someone you follow, or if the person is a X Blue
subscriber.How to post a reply                    Find the post you want to

let us know.Note:  These prompts are only available to people using X in
