Paid Partnerships policy                                While posts promoted
through X's advertising services are labeled as âPromotedâ and must abide by
our X Ads Policies, organic, non-promoted posts may also be considered paid
product placements, endorsements, or advertisements (âPaid Partnershipsâ). 
         The following are examples of Paid Partnerships:        A user,
including a creator or brand, has been or may be compensated for a post
(including in the form of money, gifts, loans of products, or other rewards or
incentives), or   A post is created as part of, or in connection with, a
commercial relationship (such as a current or recent âbrand ambassadorâ
arrangement), or   A post includes an affiliate link or discount code through
which the user might receive some kind of benefit, incentive or reward       
posts that are part of a Paid Partnership posted as an organic post will require
clear and prominent disclosures indicating the commercial nature of such
content.For example, â#adâ, â#paidpartnershipâ, â#sponsoredâ.  
Failure to include an appropriate disclosure in a clear and prominent way could
result in enforcement actions.     In addition to abiding by the X Rules, users,
including creators and brands, that participate in Paid Partnerships are
responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including
but not limited to, all advertising laws and, where applicable, FTC regulations
including the FTCâs Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials
in Advertising.     The rules and guidance that apply to Paid Partnerships may
vary country to country, and can change, so check that you are following all the
latest rules and guidance in the relevant country.           The following also
applies to the United Kingdom:          Creators should include all applicable
disclosures that are required to indicate the commercial nature of their
content, such as â#adâ.Remember that all posts with commercial intent,
including own-brand posts created by a user who has a commercial interest in the
relevant brand (for example, as a director) will require a disclosure.  
Failure to include an appropriate disclosure, as mentioned in the global section
above, in a clear and prominent way could result in enforcement actions.      
Creators may also check the  Influencers' Guide to Making Clear that Ads are Ads
as provided by Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Competition &
Markets Authority (CMA).     Users who believe they have viewed a Paid
Partnership which does not include an appropriate disclosure, may report their
concerns directly to the relevant brand or to an appropriate regulatory
authority, such as the  Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).Share this article
