RePost FAQs                                                        What is a
Repost?        A Repost is a re-posting of a post.X's Repost feature helps you
and others quickly share that post with all of your followers.You can Repost
your own posts or posts from someone else.Sometimes people type "RT" at the
beginning of a post to indicate that they are re-posting someone else's
content.This isn't an official X command or feature, but signifies that they are
quoting another person's post.What does a Repost look like?         Reposts look
like normal posts with the author's name and username next to it, but are
distinguished by the   Repost   icon   and the name of the person who Reposted
the post.If you see content from someone you do not follow in your timeline,
look for   Reposted by   info in the postâthe Reposter should be someone you
follow.Note:  Reposts may appear differently in third-party applications, and
will show up in apps only if they are using X's Repost API.Many apps have built
in their own version of Repostingâthose posts are not treated as official
Reposts on X.To test, try Reposting from a third-party app, then check your
profile on the web.Where do Reposts appear?        posts Reposted by other
people:   You can see posts people you follow have Reposted and Quote posted in
your Home timeline.Repost and Quote posts, like regular posts, will not show up
from accounts you have blocked.     Your posts that others have Reposted and
Quote posted:   Go to your  Notifications  tab.There you will see all activity
concerning your postsâincluding which have recently been Reposted and by
whom.From the post detail page, youâll be able to see how many Reposts of your
post there are, in additon to how many Quote posts there are.   To view who
Reposted you, tap the  Reposts  tab.   To view who Quote posted you, tap the
Quote posts  tab.       How do I turn Reposts off?        You can turn off
Reposts for a specific account if you donât like what they share.Select  Turn
off Reposts  from an account profile page to stop seeing posts they've Reposted
(tap the  gear  icon            on iOS or click or tap the  overflow  icon
 on web and Android).Turning Reposts on or off is not retroactive, meaning that
you can't remove Reposts that are already in your timeline.It is not possible to
turn off ALL Reposts from ALL accounts.     How can I undo or delete my Repost?
    You can undo a Repost you've made by clicking on the highlighted  Repost
icon   in the post.This will remove the Repost from your timeline, but will not
delete the original post.     Why can I no longer see my Repost?        If the
original post was deleted by its author or otherwise removed from the service,
or if the original post authorâs account was deleted or suspended, your Repost
will no longer be available.     Why can't some posts be Reposted?         If
you see the  lock  icon          next to someone's name on their profile page or
on their posts, their posts are protected and you will not be able to Repost
their content.If your posts are  protected , you can still repost and  Quote
post.Only people you have allowed to follow you will be able to view them.You
can see protected posts from an account you follow in your timeline because that
account has accepted your follow request, but because they have chosen not to
share their posts publicly, their posts cannot be reposted by you or anyone
else.     Are there limits on reposts?         There is no limit to the number
of times a post can be reposted, but X will only show up to the most recent 100
people who reposted any public post.reposts are counted toward your  1,000 posts
per day limit.Share this article                                    Post
