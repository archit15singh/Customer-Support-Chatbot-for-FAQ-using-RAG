Report abusive behavior                                X strives to provide an
environment where people  can feel free to express themselves.If abusive
behavior happens, we want to make it easy for people  to report it to
us.Multiple posts can be included in the same report, helping us gain better
context, while investigating the issues to get them resolved faster.Weâve
recently updated our reporting experience to take a "symptoms-first" approach,
providing a welcoming, conversational space for people to describe whatâs
happening with example posts to provide as much context and education throughout
the processâwhich we believe will create a safer experience and build trust
with reporters.Improving the ability to report is  just one step  of our work to
protect our users and make X safer.Learn more about our new approach  here.

You can report posts, profiles, or Direct Messages directly to us (see above).X
may take action on the threatening post, Direct Message, and/or the responsible
account.However, if someone has posted or messaged a violent threat that you
feel is credible or you fear for your own or someone elseâs physical safety,
you may want to contact your local law enforcement agency.They can accurately
assess the validity of the threat, investigate the source of the threat, and
respond to concerns about physical safety.If contacted by law enforcement
directly, we can work with them and provide the necessary information for their
investigation of the threat.For post reports only: You can get your own copy of
your report of a violent threat to share with law enforcement by clicking  Email
report  on the  We have received your report  screen.What happens after I submit
a report?       After you submit a report, you will see a confirmation message
from us alerting you that we received your report (it may take up to 24 hours
before you see a message).We will review the reported account and/or post(s),
and/or Direct Message(s).If we determine that the account, and/or post(s),
and/or Direct Message(s) are in violation of our policies, we will take action
(ranging from a warning to permanently suspending the account).You will receive
a follow up from us if we need more information from you, or when we take action
on the reported account, and/or post(s), and/or Direct Message(s).Additionally,
the original content of reported posts will be replaced with a notice stating
that you reported it.You may click through and view the post should you wish. 
Note:  Additionally, you will receive an in-product notification if an action is
taken on an account that you recently reported.This action may or may not be
related to your report.Why canât X block an account from making new accounts?
    IP blocking is generally ineffective at stopping unwanted behavior, and may
falsely prevent legitimate accounts from accessing our service.IP addresses are
commonly shared by many accounts in a variety of locations, meaning that
blocking a single IP may prevent a large number of unconnected accounts from
logging in to X.In addition, IP addresses are easy to change and blocks can be
easily circumvented by logging in from a different location, a third-party
service, or one of many free websites or applications.Can X give me another
accountâs information?       Per our  Privacy Policy , X does not release
account information except as required by valid legal process.If you are working
with the police or your lawyer, they will be able to help you with the
appropriate and correct legal process for obtaining such information.If X is
contacted directly by law enforcement, we can work with them and provide
assistance for their investigation.You can point law enforcement officials to
our  Guidelines for Law Enforcement.Share this article
