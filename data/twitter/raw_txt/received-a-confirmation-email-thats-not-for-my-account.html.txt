Help with confirmation emails
Are you getting emails in your inbox for a X account you didn't sign up for?
Typically this is just a case of honest confusion â it's likely someone signed
up for a X account and mistyped their email, using yours instead.Read on to
learn how to resolve the problem.How to remove your email from the account
Click the "not my account" link  that appears in the confirmation email we sent
to your email inbox.You will be taken to a page that shows a screen asking you
to confirm the removal of your email from that specific X account.If you own the
email and did NOT create the X account , click the large gray  Opt-out
button.Your email account will be disassociated from the X account, and you'll
see a confirmation screen.Note:   If you remove your email from an account you
didn't create, you can still use it later to create a X account of your own. 
Need Help?         Did you click the "Not my account" link in error?   Visit
