About public-interest exceptions on X
Defining the public interest   X has clear policies on content and behavior that
violates X rules and we take the appropriate action against content and accounts
that violate our rules.However, we recognize that sometimes it may be in the
public interest to allow people to view posts that would otherwise violate our
policies.We consider content to be in the public interest if it directly
contributes to understanding or discussion of a matter of public concern.In
certain and rare instances, we may choose to leave up a post from an elected or
government official that would otherwise violate our policies, given the
significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions
and statements.Instead we will place it behind a notice providing context about
the rule violation that allows people to click through to see the post.Placing a
post behind this notice also limits the ability to engage with the post through
likes, Reposts, or sharing on X, and makes sure the post isn't algorithmically
recommended by X.These actions are meant to limit the postâs reach while
maintaining the publicâs ability to view and discuss it.When is it in the
public interest to preserve access to a post?     We decide whether a post that
would otherwise violate the X Rules is in the public interest using the
following criteria and process:        Criteria for exceptions         The post
violates one or more  X Rules ; The post was shared by a high profile account;
and,   The account represents a current or potential member of a local, state,
national, or supra-national governmental or legislative body:   Current holders
of an elected or appointed leadership position in a governmental or legislative
body, OR Candidates or nominees for political office, OR Registered political
parties          Process         Our global enforcement team will escalate any
post that meets the criteria defined above for secondary review by our Trust &
Safety team.Our Trust & Safety team will evaluate the post and prepare a
recommendation on whether or not continued access to the post is in the public
interest.This includes a consideration of local context and any potential for
offline harm.More details provided below.     Senior leaders from Trust & Safety
will make the final decision to remove the post or apply the notice.     How we
balance risk of harm vs.the public interest       The public interest exception
does not mean that any eligible public official can post whatever they want,
even if it violates the X Rules.When deciding whether to remove a post or place
it behind a notice, we weigh the potential risk and severity of harm against the
public-interest value of the post.Where the risk of harm is higher and/or more
severe, we are less likely to make an exception.We are more likely to apply the
notice to a violative post if:   The post is directed at other government or
elected officials or institutions as part of a public debate or call to protest;
There is a larger point to the post that is relevant to the author or targetâs
public role; The post adds significant context to ongoing geopolitical events or
issues; or There is significant documentary or accountability value in
preserving the content as a matter of public record.     We are more likely to
remove the post without applying the notice if:   The post includes a
declarative call to action that could harm a specific individual or group; The
post shares information or engages in behavior that could directly interfere
with an individualâs exercise of their fundamental rights.     We recognize
the desire for these decisions to be clearcut yes/no binaries.Unfortunately, the
reality is that they can't be.This is new territory for everyone â a service
being used by world leaders to communicate directly to their constituents or
other leaders, and at times, announce policy â and every decision we make sets
a new precedent.We believe it is critical that we evaluate every case
individually and in a way that accounts for context and history.Over time, as we
evaluate more posts and make more of these decisions, we will be establishing a
case history that makes these calls easier to make.The table below provides a
high-level overview of the thinking behind how we evaluate whether to remove or
apply the notice across a range of the X Rules.As with all our policies, we
continue to respect local laws and balance other principles, including freedom
of expression, when enforcing our rules.Even when content qualifies for the
public-interest exception, we will continue to comply with applicable local
laws, as provided by our  country-withheld content  policy.     When we're less
likely to make exceptions         Terrorism / violent extremism :   You may not
threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.       There is no place on X
for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and individuals who
affiliate with and promote their illicit activities.Given the severe physical
harm that can result from the activities of these groups, we do not anticipate
cases where the public-interest exception would apply.          Violence :   You
may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people.We also
prohibit the glorification of violence.     Content that threatens or glorifies
violence can result in some of the most severe and immediate harms our rules are
meant to address, and public-interest exceptions are therefore unlikely.We will
especially err on the side of removal in cases where there is evidence the
content may be leading to actual or likely offline harm.In very rare instances,
we may decide that content is worthy of a public-interest exception if there is
a more attenuated connection to actual violence, or if X is the only source of
the information.     Illegal or certain regulated goods or services :  You may
not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal
activities.This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in
illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or
services.     In an effort to address the potential for offline harm, we do not
allow the use of X for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities.In
rare instances, for example if there is significant documentary or
accountability value in preserving the content as a matter of public record, we
may choose to leave the content up behind the notice.     Suicide or self-harm :
You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.     Social contagion as a
result of self-harming content is a severe and immediate harm that can occur on
the service, and the public-interest exception is unlikely to override the
potential for offline harm.We may sometimes leave content up behind the notice
for cases of hyperbolic political statements, particularly if they target other
public figures in the context of some relevant public debate.But we will err
toward removal for content that targets private figures or where it is likely to
cause offline harm.     Election integrity :  You may not use Xâs services for
the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections.This includes posting or
sharing content that may suppress voter turnout or mislead people about when,
where, or how to vote.     Participation in free and fair elections is a
fundamental human right â and X views activity that interferes in someoneâs
ability to participate in an election, or which attempts to mislead about or
deter them from participating, as a significant harm.There may be high public
interest in the fact that an official has shared violative content, but, given
the severity of the harm if viewers are misled or influenced by the content, it
is very unlikely that such content would remain on the platform.     Private
information :   You may not publish or post other people's private information
(such as home phone number and address) without their express authorization and
permission.We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or
incentivizing others to do so.Sharing the personal information of an individual
has the potential to generate severe and immediate harm both on and off X, and
public-interest exceptions are unlikely to outweigh this harm, given the need to
protect victims.However, there may be high public interest in the fact that an
official is threatening to share violative content, and we may make exceptions
where the personal information itself is not present.     When we're more likely
to make exceptions         Hateful conduct :   Content promoting violence
against, threatening, or harassing other people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious
affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.This includes content that
dehumanizes or incites fear about people based on their protected
characteristics.X stands for the value of direct access to powerful figures, and
maintaining a robust public record provides benefits to accountability.This
value will be weighed against the likelihood and severity of actual or potential
offline harm associated with a violation of these policies.For example, we may
leave political statements that are part of a public debate up behind a
notice.We take various factors into account when assessing for Hateful Conduct
and will determine the penalty, such as making the content less visible or
removing, based on the evidence of   actual or likelihood of offline harm.  
Abuse / harassment :   You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone,
or incite other people to do so.This includes content denying that mass murder
or other mass casualty events took place, where we can verify that the event
occurred, and when the content is shared with abusive context or using
aggressive insults with the purpose of harassing or intimidating others.X stands
for the value of direct access to government and elected officials, and
maintaining a robust public record provides benefits to accountability.This
value will be weighed against the severity of the harm associated with the
violation of these policies and the likelihood of offline harm.For example,
insults may be present in posts related to heated debate over matters of public
policy.We are more likely to remove a post if the content targets a private
individual without any relevant political context.     Sensitive media :   You
may not share any media that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content
related to death, violence or severe physical harm, or violent content that is
shared for sadistic purposes.     X stands for the value of direct access to
powerful figures, and maintaining a robust public record for an important
historical event provides benefits to accountability.This value will be weighed
against the likelihood and severity of the actual or potential harm associated
with the violation of this policy.Note:   Given the acute harm that media
involving child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and violent sexual
assault can inflict on victims, we do not anticipate cases where the public
interest exception would apply.Additionally, we will remove content, and not
apply a notice, for infringement of copyrighted material.X platform
