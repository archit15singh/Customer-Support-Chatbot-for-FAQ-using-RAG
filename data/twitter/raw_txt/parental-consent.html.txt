About parental consent on X                                X requires people
using our service to be 13 years of age or older.In some countries, the law
requires a parent or guardian to give consent for people older than 13, but
under the age of consent in their country, to use our service.If you do not meet
our age requirements, weâll lock your X account and youâll receive a notice
from us letting you know that we need parental consent in order to re-activate
it.Why is this happening?       To meet legal requirements for online services
where you live, if you do not meet our age requirements, weâll need to
promptly lock your account until certain steps are taken.We understand this
change is an abrupt and inconvenient disruption.Our goal, however, is to help
navigate you through this process as smoothly as we can and to get you back to
posting.          What do we need from you?     If you receive a parent consent
notice for your account, and you otherwise meet the requirements to continue
using our service, youâll be prompted to have your parent or guardian fill out
this  form.We recommend completing the form as soon as possible, as it can take
up to 60 days to process your request.     Weâll notify you through X when
your account is up and running again.Note:   When your account is eligible for
restoration, youâll have 30 days to complete and submit your request, after
which, youâll no longer be able to regain access to your account.What is the
process like?     Weâve aimed to make this as straightforward as possible for
you.Hereâs the rundown:   Weâll notify you through X that your account has
been locked, and weâll need a parent or guardian to give consent to re-
activate your X account.Your parent or guardian fills out this  form  ââ
note that we require proof of identification and guardianship.(Any supporting
documentation you send to us will be kept confidential and deleted from our
systems after we review them.) Should we need more information as we start the
process, weâll follow up with your parent or guardian.When youâre approved
and cleared to get back into your account, weâll let you know.
