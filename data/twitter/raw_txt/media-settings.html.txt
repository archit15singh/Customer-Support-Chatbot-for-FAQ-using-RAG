posts that contain sensitive media                          The option to add
one-time sensitive content warnings to photos and videos you post is now
available for everyone across Android, iOS, and web.To add a content warning,
tap or click on the flag icon when editing the photo or video after you've
attached it to your post.This allows you to choose marking the photo or video as
Nudity, Violence, or Sensitive.                                       You can
control your preferences for how and when you may see sensitive content in your
 media settings.What if I donât change my media settings and post sensitive
media?     If one of your posts containing media is reported as sensitive, it
will be sent to X for review.If we find that the media wasnât marked as being
potentially sensitive at the time of the upload:   We may label the media as
being potentially sensitive, or in the case of live video, remove the content
entirely.We may also change your account setting to  Mark media you post as
containing material that may be sensitive  so that future posts are marked
accordingly.You will see this action has been taken on your account with a
label.          You will be able to change your media settings on your account
settings page, though this image and any other images that have been labeled
will remain marked as potentially sensitive.             If you repeatedly
upload media that is mislabeled, we may:   Label your account as having
potentially sensitive content.Permanently adjust your account setting to  Mark
media you post as containing material that may be sensitive  so that your future
posts have a warning message users must click through before viewing your media.
    X may also use automated techniques to detect and label potentially
sensitive media, and to detect and label accounts that frequently post
potentially sensitive media.     What happens if my profile image is in
violation of the X Rules?     If your profile or header image contains content
in violation of the X Rules, we may temporarily suspend your account and remove
the offending content.Repeat violations will result in a permanent
suspension.Additionally, your account may be locked if media in your profile is
in violation of X's media policy.In order to unlock your account, you will need
to follow our instructions and remove the media in violation.If your account has
been locked, see this  article  for more information.     Can I appeal a
decision made by X?     If you are suspended for having graphic violence or
adult content in your profile image or header image you can appeal by logging
into your account and submitting an appeal  here.In response to repeated
mislabeling of sensitive content, X may change your account setting to   Mark
media you post as containing material that may be sensitive   and your account
will receive a label.
