Help with common following issues
I can't follow anyone        You may be trying to follow accounts with
protected posts.Accounts with protected posts will first need to approve your
request to follow them.You may have hit a  following limit.   We only allow you
to follow a certain number of accounts per day and per account in order to limit
spam.Learn more about  follow limits.                      I can't unfollow
someone                    Sign in to X and find the account's profile by either
searching  for them, or by visiting your  following list.Hover over the
Following  button next to the account you don't want to follow anymore via
web.It will turn red and say  Unfollow.Click  Unfollow  and the account will be
removed from your following list.If it doesn't turn red or click, refresh the
page and try again, or click the account's name to visit their profile page and
unfollow them there.To unfollow a particular account from the X for iOS or
Android apps: Navigate to your following list and tap the  following  icon next
to the account name.If you have trouble, visit their profile page and tap the
following  icon to unfollow.My follower count is wrong         If you received a
notification from X alerting you to a new follower, but don't see that person
later in your followers list, it's likely that account was hidden for spam
activity, unfollowed you, or deactivated their account.To see the full list of
your followers, including suspected spam accounts, turn off the quality filter
in your settings.To learn how, read our  About the Notifications timeline
article.     It looks like I'm not following someone I know I followed     
Find the account's profile by either  searching  for them or by entering their
username in your browser.Example: http://x.com/username.Confirm that a blue
Following box shows when you visit their profile.If it shows  Following , their
posts should appear in your  Home timeline.If it doesn't show, they may have
blocked you.Click or tap  Follow  on their profile.An error message means the
account has blocked you from following them.Read more about  blocking.Need more
