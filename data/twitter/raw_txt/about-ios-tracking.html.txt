Tracking on iOS 14.5+                                                        If
you are using X for iOS 14.5 and up, X is required to request permission to
track data on your device from other companies, like apps you use and websites
you visit.     For each iOS 14.5 and up device that you use X on, you will see a
prompt from X providing information about Xâs tracking, followed by a tracking
prompt from your iOS device for the X app.     X discloses its tracking for the
latest version of Xâs iOS app in its   App Privacy section   on the X product
page in the App Store.You can learn more about how X handles your information,
including tracking data on your device from other companies, in the   X Privacy
Policy.             How can I control Xâs tracking on my iOS 14.5+ device?
If you allow tracking through the prompting process described above, X will
engage in tracking on the device that you granted the permission to track as
described in our   App Privacy section.If you choose not to allow tracking, X
will not engage in tracking on that device.     These choices only affect how X
may or may not track data on the applicable device going forward, after you have
responded to Xâs iOS 14.5+ tracking prompt.  Your choice may not go into
effect immediately.Regardless of whether you allowed or declined X permission to
track you through the prompts described above, you can always go to your iOS
device settings and select X to adjust whether to allow tracking.Share this
