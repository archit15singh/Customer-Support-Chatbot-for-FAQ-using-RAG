What's phishing?     Phishing scammers send fraudulent messages to a large
number of people, in an attempt to trick them into revealing private
information, like a password.An email or website may be disguised to appear
legitimate.It can be difficult to recognize a spoofed email as they may look
very convincing or appear to come from an X email address.You can check the
headers of an email to find out more about the source of the message, and you
should be suspicious of new or unexpected emails.X doesn't send emails with
attachments, and will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct
Message, or reply.     What if I'm worried that someone has access to my X
username and password?         If you suspect your account has been compromised,
you can find out what to do on our  compromised accounts help page.If X believes
your account has been hacked, we may reset the account password to prevent the
hacker from misusing your account.In this case, we'll email you a secure link to
where you can select a new password.Again, this link will always be on the
https://X.com  website, and we never ask you to provide your password via email,
Direct Message, or reply.     Why am I getting these fake emails?       X
doesn't send these emails.The FTC has a help page that describes some ways
spammers may find your email address:  https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/.For more
