Our range of enforcement options
When we take enforcement actions, we may do so either on a specific piece of
content (e.g., an individual post or Direct Message), on an account, or employ a
combination of these options.In some instances, this is because the behavior
violates the  X Rules.Other times, it may be in response to a valid legal
request from an authorized entity in a given country.Below are some of the
enforcement actions that we may take.     Post-level enforcement   We take
action at the post level when a specific post violates the X Rules, including
posts that share or reproduce other posts by posting screenshots, quote-posting,
or sharing post URLs that violate our Rules.A few of the ways in which we might
take action at the post level include:   Limiting post visibility:  Where
appropriate, we will restrict the reach of posts that violate our policies and
create a negative experience for other users by making the post less  
discoverable on X.This can include:   Excluding the post from search results,
trends, and recommended notifications   Removing the post from the For you and
Following timelines   Restricting the postâs discoverability to the authorâs
profile   Downranking the post in replies   Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts,
Quote posts, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or Edit post     Excluding the
post from having ads adjacent to it:  Starting in April 2023, posts identified
as violating our Rules will begin to receive labels informing both post authors
and viewers that we limited the postâs visibility.       Authors will be able
to submit an appeal on the label if they think we incorrectly limited their
postâs visibility.     Requiring post removal:    When we determine that a
post violated the X Rules and the violation is severe enough to warrant post
removal, we will require the violator to remove it before they can post
again.They will need to go through the process of removing the violating post or
appealing  our removal request if they believe we made an error.The post will be
hidden from public view with a  notice  during this process.     Labeling a
post:  If we determine a post contains misleading or disputed information per
our policies that could potentially lead to harm, we may  add a label  to the
content to provide context and additional information to users.In these cases,
Community Notes  may also be visible on posts to provide additional
context.Notice of public interest exception:  We may determine that it is in the
public interest for a post that would otherwise be in violation of our rules to
remain accessible on our service.When this occurs, we will place the post behind
a notice and limit its visibility.Learn more  about the public interest
exception.     Direct Message-level enforcement   Stopping conversations between
a reported violator and the reporterâs account: In a private Direct Message
conversation, when a participant reports the other account, we will stop the
violator from sending messages to the account who reported them.The conversation
will also be removed from the reporter's inbox.However, if the reporter decides
to continue to send Direct Messages to the violator, the conversation will
resume.Placing a Direct Message behind a notice:  In a group Direct Message
conversation, the violating Direct Message may be placed behind a notice to
ensure no one else in the group can see it again.Account-level enforcement   We
take action to suspend an account if we determine that a user has engaged in
repeated violations of our policies and/or violated specific policies that cause
significant risk to X (i.e.posting illegal content, attempts to manipulate our
platform or spam users, using our platform to incite violence, etc.) or pose a
threat to our users (fraud, user privacy violations, violent threats, targeted
harassment, etc.).Placing an account in read-only mode:  We may temporarily
limit an accountâs ability to post, Repost, or Like.The user can read their
timelines and will only be able to send Direct Messages to their followers.  
Verifying account ownership:  We may require an account owner to verify
ownership with a phone number or email address.Note that when an account has
been locked pending completion of a challenge (such as being required to provide
a phone number), it is removed from follower counts, Reposts, and Likes.Users
can appeal account suspensions if they believe we made an error.They can do this
through the platform interface or by  filing a report.Actions we may take
against non-violating content   Placing a post behind a notice:  We may place
some forms of  sensitive media  like adult content or graphic violence behind an
interstitial advising viewers to be aware that they will see sensitive media if
they click through.Learn more about  how to control whether you see sensitive
media.Withholding a post based on age:  We restrict views of specific forms of
sensitive media such as adult content for viewers who are under 18 or viewers
who do not include a birth date on their profile with  interstitials.  
Withholding a post or account in a country:  We may withhold access to certain
content in a particular country if we receive a valid and properly scoped
request from an authorized entity in that country.Read more about  country
