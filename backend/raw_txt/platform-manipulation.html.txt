X's platform manipulation and spam policy | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Platform manipulation and spam policy Overview March 2023 You may not use X's services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts peopleâs experience or platform manipulation defenses on X.We want X to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express themselves freely and safely.To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation.We define platform manipulation as using X to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience.Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited behavior, including: commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on X to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are; coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting; coordinated harmful activity that encourages or promotes behavior which violates Our Rules ; and leveraging X's open source code to circumvent remediations or platform defenses.What is in violation of this policy? Under this policy we prohibit a range of behaviors in the following areas: Multiple accounts and coordination You canât mass-register X accounts or use automation to create X accounts.X allows users to create and/or operate up to ten (10) accounts for different, non-duplicative purposes.Users who already own or operate more than ten accounts will not be impacted by these new limits unless a violation of the X Rules takes place.Some examples of what X considers to be non-duplicative uses include: Accounts tracking when objects in space travel over a specific location on Earth, e.g.New York, Hong Kong Accounts sharing news about different professional teams in the same sport or league, e.g.NFL, NBA, Premier League Accounts for personal projects, hobbies/interests, or for your business(es) Accounts for branded entities specific to unique locations or languages, e.g.brand accounts in English, Spanish and French In addition, users are allowed to control multiple accounts on behalf of a third-party (e.g.âSocial Media Managersâ), provided that no violations of Our Rules (including this policy) occurs.X may approve exceptions to multiple account limits at its discretion. What is in violation of the Multiple Accounts policy? You canât artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts or by coordinating with others to violate Our Rules.This includes: operating multiple accounts that interact with the same or substantially similar content or X account(s) in order to inflate or manipulate the prominence of content and/or accounts; for example: Do not create multiple accounts to âboostâ trending topics or hashtags Do not create multiple accounts to engage with the same posts, accounts, or polls Do not create multiple accounts to misuse the mention/reply feature Do not create multiple accounts to boost or amplify one of your own accounts by misusing engagement features (likes, reposts) operating multiple accounts that post substantially similar or identical content to one another; for example: Do not cross-post content across multiple accounts; content that is cross-posted but localized into another language is permitted Do not cross-post similar or duplicate content to the same trending topics or hashtags Employing workarounds to exceed the technical limits of account creation (e.g.account phone number limits ) Multiple accounts that exhibit a pattern or sole purpose of the preceding behaviors may be suspended by X.Users operating multiple accounts are still subject to all other X Rules, particularly our rules surrounding Platform Manipulation and Spam, and Ban Evasion.Any other violations of Our Rules may also result in all of your accounts being suspended.Engagement and metrics You canât artificially inflate your own or othersâ followers or engagement.This includes: selling/purchasing Post or account metric inflation â selling or purchasing followers or engagements (Reposts, Likes, mentions, X Poll votes); apps â using or promoting third- party services or apps that claim to add followers or add engagements to Posts; reciprocal inflation â trading or coordinating to exchange follows or Post engagements (including but not limited to participation in âfollow trains,â âdecks,â and âRepost for Repostâ behavior); and account transfers or sales â selling, purchasing, trading, or offering the sale, purchase, or trade of X accounts, usernames, or temporary access to X accounts.Misuse of X product features You canât misuse X product features to disrupt othersâ experience.This includes: Posts and Direct Messages sending bulk, aggressive, high-volume unsolicited replies, mentions, or Direct Messages; posting and deleting the same content repeatedly; repeatedly posting identical or nearly identical Posts, or repeatedly sending identical Direct Messages; repeatedly posting content or sending Direct Messages consisting of links shared without commentary, so that this comprises the bulk of your Post/Direct Message activity; and Posting an existing phrase or content in a duplicative manner, whether individually or in concert with other accounts.Learn more in our copypasta and duplicate content policy.Editing Posts editing Posts to artificially amplify content or deceive people.Examples include, but are not limited to: using a Post's existing engagement to amplify substantially different content (e.g.editing a Post from âWhatâs better? Pancakes or waffles?â to âThousands of people trust my service.Like my post and subscribe to my channel to get tips on investingâ) editing links (URLs) so that the final destination page has significantly changed, either in content or location (e.g.domain, URL path) editing media (e.g.images, videos, audios, gifs, or URLs hosting relevant content) so the Post is meaningfully or entirely different or irrelevant to the previous versions.Following âfollow churnâ â following and then unfollowing large numbers of accounts in an effort to inflate oneâs own follower count; indiscriminate following â following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short time period, particularly by automated means; and duplicating another accountâs followers, particularly using automation. Engagement aggressively or automatically engaging with Posts to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives.aggressively adding users to Lists or Moments. Hashtags using a trending or popular hashtag with an intent to subvert or manipulate a conversation or to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; and Posting with excessive, unrelated hashtags in a single Post or across multiple Posts. URLs publishing or linking to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another personâs browser (malware) or computer or to compromise a personâs privacy (phishing); and posting misleading or deceptive links; e.g., affiliate links and clickjacking links.Open Source Code exploiting X's open source code, including the logic behind visibility filtering or ML Model training, to circumvent policy enforcement for violations of Our Rules.What is not a violation of this policy? The following are not in violation of this policy: posting links without commentary occasionally; coordinating with others to express ideas, viewpoints, support, or opposition towards a cause, provided such behavior does not result in violations of Our Rules; and operating multiple accounts with distinct identities, purposes, or use cases.These accounts may interact with one another, provided they donât violate other rules.Some examples include: organizations with related but separate chapters or branches, such as a business with multiple locations; operating a personal account in addition to pseudonymous accounts or accounts associated with your hobbies or initiatives; and hobby/artistic bots.Who can report violations of this policy?
