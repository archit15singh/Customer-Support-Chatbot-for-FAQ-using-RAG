Copypasta and duplicate content policy | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Copypasta and duplicate content policy Overview May 2022 In order to help people find credible and authentic information, and to promote a healthy public discourse on X, we limit the visibility of duplicative (or also known as âcopypastaâ) Posts.What is Copypasta? âCopypastaâ (a reference to copy-and-paste functionality to duplicate content) is an Internet slang term that refers to an attempt by multiple individuals to duplicate content from an original source and share it widely across social platforms or forums. On X, copypasta or duplicative content can be a block of text, image or a combination of content that has been copied and pasted, or duplicated by any means across the platform. While copypasta or duplicate content is a tactic for propagating a message, and is used for a wide range of purposes, it can be repetitive, spammy, and disruptive to peopleâs experience on X.Duplicative content can also be used to artificially amplify content, suppress information or manipulate X's Trends, Top Search results and conversations across the platform. What happens if my Posts have limited visibility? Limiting the visibility of Posts means that they may not appear in certain parts of the X product, and/or may not be recommended or amplified by X.Some of the ways we may do this include: making Posts ineligible for amplification in Top Search results and on Trends; not recommending Posts in timelines of users who donât follow the Post author; downranking Posts in replies; and excluding Posts and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. Duplicate content or copypasta Posts remain visible to users who follow the Post author.Learn more about other instances when a Post's visibility may be limited. Examples of behavior for which we limit visibility under this policy include: identical or near- identical content Posted by an individual account or many accounts, even if the users involved only use one account; duplicate or copy-pasted Posts that may disrupt the experience of others, including mentioning users or using hashtags with the same Post content in concert with other accounts. Examples of behavior for which we do not limit visibility under this policy include: Reposting existing content using the Repost feature; and copy-pasting, or Posting existing content, combined with your own unique content, commentary, or reaction, or explicitly quoting the copied content.What is considered a severe violation of this policy? While copypasta or duplicative Posts on their own do not result in Post removals or account suspensions, they are subject to review and enforcement under our platform manipulation and spam policy and any other X Rules violations. Examples of behavior that may result in removal or permanent suspension include: using automation or scripting to post duplicative content; operating one account or multiple accounts where the majority of the content promotes duplicative content resulting in spammy, inauthentic engagement; and repeated participation in copypasta and duplicate Post efforts to promote content that is in violation of other X Rules.Who can report violations of this policy?
