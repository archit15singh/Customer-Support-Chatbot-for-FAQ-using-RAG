Understanding when content is withheld based on country Skip to main content Help Center About country withheld content Why might content be withheld? If you have encountered a post or an account that has been marked as withheld, you may be wondering what that means and why that may have happened.With hundreds of millions of posts posted every day around the world, our goal is to respect user expression, while also taking into consideration applicable local laws.Many countries, including the United States, have laws that may apply to posts and/or X account content.In our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere, if we receive a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time. Such withholdings will be limited to the specific jurisdiction that has issued the valid legal demand or where the content has been found to violate local law(s).Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content.Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify affected users and clearly indicate within the product unless we are prohibited from doing so (e.g., if we receive a court order under seal).We strongly believe that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact, and that the posts must continue to flow. How do you know if content has been withheld and why? Withheld posts: If you see the above message, it means X was compelled to withhold the original post in response to a valid legal demand, such as a court order.If you see the above message, it means X withheld content based on local law(s) in response to a report filed through specific support intake channels.Withheld accounts: If you see the above message, it means X was compelled to withhold the entire account specified (e.g., @username) in response to a valid legal demand, such as a court order.If you see the above message, it means X withheld the entire account based on local law(s) in response to a report filed through specific support intake channels. How do you know where I am? We use information that we may receive about your location to determine your country. How can I submit a legal request to have content withheld? If you are a law enforcement agent, government official, or other third-party intending to submit a valid legal request and would like to have potentially illegal content or accounts removed from X, we ask that you first review the X Rules and, if applicable, submit a request to have the content reviewed for possible violations of Xâs Terms of Service , here: https://help.twitter.com/forms.If you have already submitted a request and have received a response from X indicating that the content in question does not currently violate Xâs Terms of Service, you can submit a request for content to be withheld through our legal request submission site: https://legalrequests.twitter.com.You will then receive an automated response confirming that your request has been received by our support system.We will send another email once weâve had a chance to evaluate your request.NOTE: As previously stated, we will promptly notify affected users upon receipt of requests to withhold content unless we are prohibited from doing so (e.g., if we receive a court order under seal).This notification will include a copy of your takedown request. How do I know if my content has been withheld? What can I do about it? Unless prohibited, X will attempt to notify affected users of any third-party requests to withhold their content via the email address associated with the affected X account(s) and/or through a notification within the X app.This will typically include identification of the specific content that has been reported or withheld and the origin of the request.If you believe your content was withheld in error, you may appeal by responding directly to the email we sent notifying you of the withholding (if based on a legal demand) or by contacting us through our Help Center (if withheld based on local law).Additionally, posts and/or accounts that are withheld include a clear visual indicator.Here are a couple examples from the affected account holderâs point of view: It is up to the affected user to decide whether to challenge the underlying request.Separately, the user may decide to leave the content online, remove one or more posts , or deactivate their X account.More information for affected users is available in our legal request FAQs.For more general information, please see X's Terms of Service and Rules.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
