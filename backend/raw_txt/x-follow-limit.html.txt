What is the X follow limit and ratio? | X Help Skip to main content Help Center About following on X Overview March 2019 Following accounts is an easy way to curate your X feed and know whatâs happening with the topics or people youâre interested in.To prevent spam and manipulation of follow relationships and to ensure site reliability, there are technical limits regarding how many X accounts you are able to follow.These limits are based on the rate at which you are following new accounts, as well as how many followers you have.In addition, because follow relationships on X arenât mutual by nature, weâve also put into place a few rules around follow behavior to promote authentic experiences.What are the technical follow limits? We donât limit the number of accounts you can follow overall, but there are some limits as to the pace at which you can do so.Every X account is able to follow up to 400 accounts per day. In addition to the daily limits, there are follow ratios that go into effect once youâre following a certain number of accounts: Every X account can follow up to 5,000 accounts.Once you reach that number, you may need to wait until your account has more followers before you can follow additional accounts. This number is different for each account and is automatically calculated based on your unique ratio of followers to following.Are there other rules that apply to follow behavior? Yes.The X Rules prohibit abusive following, and violation of these rules may result in the suspension of your account.Specifically, the rules prohibit: âfollow churnâ â following and then unfollowing large numbers of accounts in an effort to inflate oneâs own follower count; indiscriminate following â following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short time period, particularly by automated means; duplicating another accountâs followers, particularly using automation; and using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to add followers.X ratio details You may encounter a message that states, âYou are unable to follow more people at this time.â Youâll encounter this message for one of the following reasons: Youâve reached the daily follow limit.You can follow more accounts after a day has passed.You've followed too many accounts too quickly.Try again in an hour or so.Youâve hit a follow ratio limit.You can try again once your account has more followers, or you can unfollow a few accounts to follow new ones.Your account is locked or limited.We may lock an account if appears to be compromised or if it is in violation of the X Rules or Terms of Service , including due to aggressive follow behavior.Accounts in a locked state are limited in actions they can perform, including following.Read more about locked and limited accounts.Additional resources Learn more about our automation rules and best practices (intended for developers), and our following FAQs.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
