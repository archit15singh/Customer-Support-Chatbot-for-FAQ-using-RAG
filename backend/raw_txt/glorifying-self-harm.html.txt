Suicide and Self-harm policy
Overview        You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.At X, we
recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health
challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders â public,
private, and civil society â and that we have a role and responsibility to
help people access and receive support when they need it.When developing this
policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have
engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal
experiences.We also recognized the need to protect people from the potential
harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-harm â
intentionally or inadvertently.Thatâs why our policy prohibits content that
promotes or encourages self-harming behaviors and provides support to those
undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts.     What is in
violation of this policy?         Under this policy, you canât promote, or
otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm.We define promotion and encouragement
to include statements such as âthe most effectiveâ, âthe easiestâ,
âthe bestâ, âthe most successfulâ, âyou shouldâ, âwhy donât
youâ.Violations of this policy can occur via Posts, images or videos,
including live video.     We define suicide to be the act of taking oneâs own
life.We define self-harm to include:   self-inflicted physical injuries e.g.,
cutting; and   eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia.       Violations of
this policy include, but are not limited to:     encouraging someone to
physically harm or kill themselves;   asking others for encouragement to engage
in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group suicides or
suicide games; and   sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions
that would assist people to engage in self-harm and suicide.     What is not a
violation of this policy?         Some examples of behavior that are not
considered a violation of this policy include:     sharing personal stories and
experiences related to self-harm or suicide;   sharing coping mechanisms and
resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and   discussions that
are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide
prevention.       Note : people can share their personal experiences, but should
avoid sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related
to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior.     Who can
report violations of this policy?         Anyone can report content that may
encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or our
specialized reporting form.These reports are routed to a dedicated team who
evaluate each case individually.     Note: if we receive a report that someone
has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will contact
them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about
dedicated online and hotline resources.We may also work with law enforcement
officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a valid emergency
disclosure request as defined in our  Law Enforcement Guidelines.     How to
report violations of this policy         To ensure that we handle reports
sensitively, our in-app reporting provides separate options for people who may
be expressing an intention to harm themselves, and content that is encouraging
or promoting self-harm or suicide.     Expressing intentions of self-harm or
suicide         In-App   You can report content for review in-app as follows:

this policy?         Our enforcement approach depends on the type of content
being shared, whether or not the reported account is encouraging or promoting
self-harm or suicide, and the accountâs previous history of violations.     If
you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages others
to harm themselves, ask others to encourage you to harm yourself, or share
detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide methods, we
will require you to remove this content.We will also temporarily lock you out of
your account before you can Post again.If you continue to violate this policy,
or if your account is dedicated to promoting or encouraging self-harm or
suicide, your account will be permanently suspended.If cases include images or
videos related to self-harm or suicide, we will also evaluate this content under
our sensitive media policy.If you believe that your account was suspended in
error,  you can submit an appeal.We may also take steps to prevent the spread of
instructional material hosted on third-party websites by  marking such links as
unsafe.         Additional resources       Learn more about our  range of
