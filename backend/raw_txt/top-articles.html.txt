The Top Articles listed under the People they follow tab are generated from the most-shared articles from people you follow, plus the people they follow on X.We select which X accounts to include in determining the list of articles under People they follow by looking at various engagement metrics around the ways people interact with each other on X.Greater interactions between people you follow and people they follow suggests a stronger relationship between you and people you don't follow, resulting in a higher ranking of the articles shown on the People they follow tab.For example, letâs say you follow someone and regularly reply to their posts.If the person you follow regularly reposts content from a person you donât follow, we would use that information to determine how interested you might be in the articles posted by the person you donât follow and reposted by the person you do follow.For each person you follow we select the top 100 people they follow based on these metrics, up to a maximum of 10,000 total.After that, we look at the most posted, reposted or quote reposted articles by those 10,000 people.Will I have to see content from accounts I blocked or muted if I use the 'People they follow' tab? No, any accounts you have blocked or muted will not be used in determining which articles or conversations you see in your People they follow list.Will I see content I may not want to see? Because People they follow includes posts by accounts you follow, plus by the people they follow, you may see articles or posts from accounts you donât follow and content that you have not chosen to see.You can avoid this by not tapping on the People they follow tab option.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
