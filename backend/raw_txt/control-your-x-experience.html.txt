Customizing your X experience | X Help Skip to main content Help Center How to control your X experience X is a place to share ideas and information, connect with your communities, and see the world around you.In order to protect the very best parts of that experience, we provide tools designed to help you control what you see and what others can see about you, so that you can express yourself on X with confidence. We make it easy for you to take action on a post.Tap the icon at the top of any post, right from your timeline, to quickly access options like unfollow, mute, block, report, and more. To further enhance the X experience, we may also apply controls to an account while we make sure thereâs a human behind an account. Unfollow Unfollowing is the simplest action you can take to stop seeing someoneâs posts on your timeline.You can always follow an account again if you change your mind.You can access this option from the icon in a post.Read more about how to unfollow people.Filter Notifications Your Notifications timeline displays your interactions with other X accounts, such as mentions, likes, Reposts, and who has recently followed you.If youâre receiving unwanted replies or mentions from accounts you do not follow, you can filter the types of notifications you receive.Read instructions for adjusting your Notifications timeline.Show less often When you mark a post as Show less often , it helps X better understand the types of posts that you'd like to see less of in your timeline.We may use this information to optimize and tailor your experience in the future.You can access this option from the icon in a post. Mute Muting another X account means you will not see that account's posts in your timeline.Itâs a great way to stay connected with friends, even if you arenât interested in seeing all of their posts.Muted accounts are not notified that youâve muted them, and you will still get notifications when they mention you in posts and send you Direct Messages.You can also mute accounts you do not follow so that you donât see their posts in your Notifications timeline.Muting is different than blocking or unfollowing: Accounts you have muted have no way to tell that you are muting them.You can access this option from the icon in a post.Read more about muting accounts.You can also mute posts that contain particular words, phrases, usernames, emojis, or hashtags. Block When you block an account on X, you restrict that accountâs ability to interact with your account.It can be an effective way to handle unwanted interactions from accounts you do not want to engage with.Accounts you have blocked will not be able to view your posts, following or followers lists, likes, or lists when logged in on X, and you will not receive notifications of mentions directly from those accounts.Youâll also stop seeing their posts in your timeline.Blocked account may notice you have blocked them if they try to visit your profile or follow you, but they will not receive any notifications that you have blocked them.You can access this option from the icon in a post.Read more about blocking accounts.Report If you think an account or post is in violation of the X Rules or our Terms of Service , tell us about it by reporting the account or post to us.Some of the violations you can report include: abuse, sensitive media, impersonation, and spam.Submitting a report will take a few steps, but your report will help us make X a better place for everyone.You can access this option from the icon in a post.Read more what you can report to X.Control the media you see in posts Your Privacy and safety settings include post media options, if you decide that you want to see a warning over media in posts that may contain sensitive content.Your settings default is to provide the warning, but you can change the setting at any time.Read more about how to control the media you see in posts.Control what others see about you Protect your posts Protecting your posts means your posts will only be visible to your followers.With your posts protected, you have control of your X experience: every time someone wants to follow your account, you have the choice to accept or decline their request.Any accounts that were following you before your posts were protected will continue to follow you (which means you will not have to approve them again), but you can stop them from following you by blocking them.Read more about public and protected posts.
