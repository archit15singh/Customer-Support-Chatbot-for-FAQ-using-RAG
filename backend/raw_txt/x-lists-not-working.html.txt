Help with Lists Skip to main content Help Center Help with Lists If you are having difficulty creating or managing your lists, read on to find out possible causes of your issue and how to fix them.List limits Some limits on X lists to be aware of are: 1000 lists permitted per account 5000 accounts permitted per list List names cannot exceed 25 characters List names cannot begin with a numerical character Replies on lists Replies work the same way for lists as they do for accounts.For example, if @XSupport and @X are on a list and they mention each other, those replies will appear in the list.However, if only @XSupport is on a list and @XSupport replies to @X, the reply will not appear on the list.There is no feature that enables list owners to send a message to every account on a list. Accounts with protected posts on lists Accounts that have opted to protect their posts can be added to lists.However, you will only see an accountâs protected posts if you have been approved to follow that account.Other people who view your list will likewise only see an accountâs protected posts if they have been approved to follow that account. Private lists Private lists are different from protected posts.Only you can view your private lists and private lists owned by other accounts will not be visible to you. Creating lists If you are unable to view a list you've recently created, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser's cache.Doing this should pull in any new lists you've created so that you can view them on your profile.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
