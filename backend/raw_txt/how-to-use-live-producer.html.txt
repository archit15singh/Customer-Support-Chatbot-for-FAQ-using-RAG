Broadcasts Broadcasts are how most people on X will be viewing your live video.Once a source has been made, you can create broadcasts , which are how people on X will view your live video.You can broadcast live right away or schedule a broadcast to happen in the future.You can also create private broadcasts to use for creating clips within LiveCut.To go live via Producer in Media Studio, we support RTMP and HLS.Follow each of the instructions below to create a source and begin broadcasting live on X.Live video specifications for RTMP and HLS Please follow the stream specifications recommendations below for the best experience.RTMP & HLS Audio Video Specifications Video codec: H.264/AVC Video bitrate: 9Mbps (recommended) 12Mbps (maximum) Audio codec: AAC-LC Audio bitrate: 128kbps (maximum) Resolution: 1280x720 (recommended) 1920 x 1080 (maximum) Frame rate: 30 fps (recommended) 60 fps (maximum) Keyframe interval OBS: Every 3 seconds Wirecast: 24 fbs = Keyframe interval of 72 frames 30 fbs = Keyframe interval of 90 frames 50 fbs = Keyframe interval of 150 frames 60 fbs = Keyframe interval of 180 frames Note: Additional HLS requirements and specifications can be found here.Going live on X using RTMP How to create an RTMP source If you have previously used Periscope Producer, you may already see sources listed in this view.Click on the Sources tab.Click Create source.For source type, choose RTMP.Enter the required fields: Source name.Region (select the region that is closest to your stream origin location).Click Create.How to publish video to an RTMP source Click on the Sources tab.Click the source you will be using to view detailed RTMP information: RTMP URL RTMP Stream Key.Tip : If preferred, you can use the RTMPS URL provided here, along with the RTMP stream key.Using the above information, update your hardware or software encoder to push video to your source.In order to test your video, follow the instructions to create a broadcast.Going live on X using RTMP - FAQs Which RTMP source region should I use? Choose the region that is closest to the source location of your encoder: Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - Tokyo, Japan Asia Pacific (Seoul) - Seoul, South Korea Asia Pacific (Mumbai) - Mumbai, India Asia Pacific (Singapore) - Singapore, Singapore Asia Pacific (Sydney) - Sydney, Australia EU (Frankfurt) - Frankfurt, Germany EU (Ireland) - Dublin, Ireland EU (Paris) - Paris, France South America (SÃ£o Paulo) - SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil US East (N.Virginia) - Northern Virginia, USA US West (N.California) - Oregon, USA US West (Oregon) - Northern California, USA What is the RTMPS URL? This is a more secure URL, adding an extra layer of security on the stream as it gets sent to X. Can I use authentication for my RTMP connection? No, we do not support authentication for RTMP connections. Can I change the location of my RTMP source after creation? No, but you may create a new source and delete old ones. Iâm trying to create a new source, but nothing happens.How can I create a new source? X has a limit of 100 sources.If you reach this limit, clicking the button to create a source will not result in a new source being created, however no error message will appear.You can re-use existing sources and delete sources that are no longer needed to free up space in your account. What is the optimal encoder profile for streaming live on X? We recommend âMainâ or âHighâ though whichever encoder you use, we highly recommend creating test broadcasts to determine the quality you wish to use. Can I utilize an existing RTMP stream from another platform (Periscope, Facebook Live, YouTube, etc.) for my source? No, it is not possible to re-use these existing streams.There must be a separate stream published to a source in Media Studio in order for us to properly ingest the video content.There are third-party services that can âsplitâ one stream in order to send it to multiple RTMP points across different platforms.These services can be used to publish live video to Producer in Media Studio.Going live on X using HLS How to create an HLS source If you have previously used Periscope Producer, you may already see sources listed in this view.Click on the Sources tab.Click Create source.For source type, choose HLS.Enter the required fields: Source name.HLS pull URL Region (select the region that is closest to your stream origin location).Read the notice that appears, and check the box if agreeing to the notice.Click Create.Going live on X using HLS - FAQs What kind of HLS streams are supported? Producer in Media Studio accepts HLS streams in the form of.m3u8 or.m3u URLs.When specifying an HLS stream URL in Xâs Media Studio, you are specifying a URL to a playlist.We accept both types -- so-called âmaster playlistsâ and âmedia playlistsâ.Producer in Media Studio will automatically select a video variant, and if audio is not multiplexed together with video, an audio variant from your âmaster playlistâ using the following logic: the video variant with highest bitrate and resolution such that the resolution is 720p or lower, unless the only video variants available are above 720p video, where the variant closest to 720p will be chosen.If audio and video are multiplexed together and separate audio renditions are provided, we will use the audio in the chosen video variant. If multiple AAC audio tracks are provided, we choose the audio track included in the rendition with the highest bandwidth.Which HLS source region should I use? Choose the region that is closest to the source location of your encoder: US West (N.California) - Oregon, USA US East (N.Virginia) - Northern Virginia, USA EU (Frankfurt) - Frankfurt, Germany Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - Tokyo, Japan How can I use a restricted HLS stream as a source in Producer in Media Studio? If you have a restricted HLS URL (by IP or geo-restriction), you may be able to use it in Media Studio by allowlisting all of the X IP addresses that may attempt to read your stream.These IPs are specific to the source region that you choose, so they may be different across different sources.To view these IPs, go to the Sources tab and click into your HLS source.Expand the âRecommended encoder settingsâ and scroll down to the âIP rangeâ field. Why does my HLS stream seem to be ingesting a low variant? For live broadcasts on X, we ignore variants that don't work for us (bad codecs and too high bitrate), and then choose the variant with the highest resolution as long as it's 1280x720 or lower.Within LiveCut, the editor may display a lower-quality variant, even if you are ingesting a higher-quality stream.Why is my HLS stream skipping or having other issues? The live window (the set of media segments listed in each update of the media playlist) should contain at least 5 segments and not more than 100 segments.If the live window is shorter, itâs possible that due to network latencies a segment may leave the window before our system has a chance to download it.This may cause the broadcast on X to skip or stop playing the portion of your stream corresponding to the missed segment(s). Please ensure your media playlist contains a minimum of 5 segments and does not exceed 100.Otherwise ensure your HLS stream matches our recommended specifications, as any deviations can result in various issues on X and in LiveCut.Why does my HLS stream have audio issues? Your streamâs HLS audio must be AAC-encoded.The audio must be mono or stereo audio, not multichannel. Going live on X using HLS - Common errors and warnings Error: âYou must enter a valid HLS URL scheme beginning with http or httpsâ The HLS URL must start with http or https and end with an.m3u8 or.m3u extension.Your URL will look something like this: https://[yourHLSstream].m3u8.If you are not sure if you have a supported stream, please contact your IT or video production team.

Click Create broadcast to create your broadcast.If you chose Start immediately , your broadcast will go live right away.If you chose Start later , your broadcast will go live at the scheduled start time.Creating a broadcast - FAQs How can I check to see if my encoder settings are within the X recommended specifications? When creating a new broadcast, scroll down to the âRecommended encoder settingsâ dropdown, which will show your encoder settings compared to Xâs recommended specifications.Modify your encoder to be within the recommended specifications before creating your broadcast. What is the âHow would you describe your video?â field? How is that category used on X? This field is only used for broadcasts being monetized in the Amplify Pre-roll program as a way to match your content with relevant advertisers.When the field is used for non-monetized, organic broadcasts, the set category is neither used nor shown on X. What does stream encryption do? Stream encryption adds an extra layer of security on top of the streamed broadcast as it plays back on X.Stream encryption is automatically turned on (and cannot be unselected) for broadcasts that have geo- restrictions in place. What does the âMake broadcast replay unavailableâ button do? Checking this box will prevent replays of a broadcast from being shown on X.If this box is checked before or during a live broadcast, all users will see a gray screen upon the ending of the broadcast (may take up to a minute to reach all viewers).You will not be able to make clips in LiveCut when a broadcast replay is unavailable.This box can be checked or unchecked at any time, allowing or disallowing the playback of the broadcast. Can I include/exclude a long list of countries for geo-restrictions? Yes, you can include or exclude as many countries as needed, however there is no way to input more than one country at a time. What is the difference between a âpublicâ and âprivateâ broadcast?â¨ Public broadcasts can be viewed by anyone on X (unless the broadcast is geo-restricted).Private broadcasts are only viewable by the user logged into Media Studio, as its primary use is to be used for broadcasts that should not be public, but will be used to create clips using LiveCut. Can I post a private broadcast?â¨ No, it is not possible to post a private broadcast, as it is only visible within Media Studio. Are broadcast scheduling and private broadcasting available in any other products or via third-party tools besides Media Studio? No, these features are only available for users within Media Studio. How long can I stream a broadcast? â¨There is no limit to how long you can stream on X.However, the longer you stream, the more likely you are to face issues in replays, slow loading of your broadcast, and within LiveCut. Can I restrict my broadcast to certain regions? To restrict the playback on X use the âGeo-restrictionsâ settings when creating your broadcasts, and then you may remove the restrictions after going live. Creating a scheduled broadcast to start later - FAQs How far in advance can I schedule my broadcast?â¨ We have set the maximum date that can be scheduled in advance at one-year in the future. What is the maximum duration for my scheduled broadcast? â¨Broadcasts scheduled to Start later are restricted to a six (6) hour maximum duration.Broadcasts that Start immediately do not have a maximum duration. Can I edit the date and duration of my scheduled broadcast, or end it early?â¨ Yes, you can edit the start and end times of a broadcast before it goes live.Once a broadcast is live, you can edit only the âEndsâ field, either to end the broadcast early, or extend the end time to a maximum of six hours. Can I post a scheduled broadcast that is not yet live?â¨ Yes, you can post any scheduled broadcast, as long as its audience setting is âPublicâ.The post for a scheduled broadcast will contain the image you uploaded during broadcast creation.Include information about the scheduled date and time within your post text to ensure users tune-in at the right time. Scheduled broadcasts are slow to load on X.com It may take up to 30 seconds for a scheduled broadcast to show live video once the scheduled broadcast starts.During this time, you may see the generic X poster image or your custom poster image. What kind of poster image can I upload for my scheduled broadcast? You are able to upload various sizes and resolutions, though we recommend a 16:9 aspect ratio image with a resolution of 1280x720 or 1920âÃâ1080.Other aspect ratios and resolutions will be automatically cropped within the broadcast card when posted. Can I schedule two broadcasts to be live at the same time, or overlap in time, on the same source? You can only have one broadcast live at a time on a single source.If you attempt to create an overlapping broadcast on a source that is already in use, or will be in use, you will get a warning message.In order to go live with multiple broadcasts at the same time, create and use multiple sources and encoders. What happens if I schedule a broadcast but am not streaming to the source at the start time? Scheduled RTMP broadcasts will go into the TIMED OUT state immediately.HLS broadcasts will go into the TIMED OUT state after 10-minutes of attempting to connect to the HLS URL.If your scheduled broadcast was posted, viewers may see an error message. When a live broadcast is scheduled, when does the X app push notification get sent? X notifications are sent out once the broadcast goes live at its scheduled start time. Will my scheduled broadcast start exactly at it scheduled start time? Scheduled broadcasts will start within the first few seconds of their scheduled start time in Media Studio. Creating a broadcast - Common errors and warnings Error: âInvalid broadcastâ This can appear when creating a scheduled broadcast.Scheduled broadcasts require the use of a source created within Media Studio.If you receive this error, you are likely utilizing a source that was originally created within Periscope.Please use a different source or create a new source within Media Studio. Warning: âWaiting for streamâ This can appear in the broadcast preview player.This warning most often appears when you have not yet selected a source. Warning: âThe media could not be playedâ This can appear in the broadcast preview player.This warning most often appears when your source is not able to detect a signal.The preview player will automatically refresh every few seconds as it continues to pull new information in from the source.

Viewing your broadcasts on X - FAQs Where can I see broadcast captions? When a broadcast with captions, or subtitles, is viewed on X, the captions will appear as an overlay atop the broadcast.By default, captions appear when the broadcastâs sound is not playing, and will be hidden when sound is playing.Some users may have captions enabled within their deviceâs accessibility settingsâif this is the case, then captions will always show, regardless of whether audio is on or if full-screen view is in use. Why canât viewers of my live broadcast use the chat functionality? The current limit for having an active chat is 5000 concurrent viewers watching; once that threshold is crossed, chat is temporarily turned off.If concurrent viewers drop below 5000, the functionality will return. Where is the title of my broadcast shown on X? Once posted, the title of your broadcast will appear on the post details page under the broadcast player.It will not appear when the post is viewed on the timeline.Can I embed a broadcast on a site outside X? No, we do not allow embedding of broadcasts outside X.However a post can be embedded, but the video will not automatically playâwhen the play button is clicked, the viewer will be directed back to X to view the broadcast.

Producer in Media Studio accepts HLS streams in the form of.m3u8 or.m3u URLs.When specifying an HLS stream URL in Xâs Media Studio, you are specifying a URL to a playlist.We accept both types -- so-called âmaster playlistsâ and âmedia playlistsâ. What kind of broadcast analytics are shown in Producer in Media Studio? All broadcast analytics for Media Studio are specific to X platforms, including X.com and the iOS and Android applications, and exclude all Periscope platforms, like the Periscope website and the iOS and Android applications The following metrics can be found within Producer in Media Studio: minutes watched (live and replay), views (live and replay), live viewers, maximum concurrent live viewers, viewership percentage by device type, and viewership percentage by country.Why do my broadcast analytics show 0 for all metrics? Check that you have not used the âhideâ functionality within the Periscope app.Unhide your broadcast via the app again to show broadcast analytics in Media Studio.If you do need your broadcast hidden from replay view, please use the âMake broadcast replay unavailableâ functionality in Media Studio. Can I separately download my broadcast analytics directly from Periscope? Yes, you are able to view and download analytics from your last 200 broadcasts directly from the Periscope.tv website.Note that the data shown in Periscope will not match the data found in Producer in Media Studio.You can view and analyze them separately, but it is not possible to aggregate the two sources.To understand why the two sources are different, please refer to the question below.If analytics are important for your organization, we recommend only utilizing the data found in Producer in Media Studio. Why do my Periscope broadcast analytics not match what I see in Producer in Media Studio? There are many reasons why the data across the two sources will not match: Older non-standard Periscope metrics The metrics tracked by the Periscope website and apps were originally created many years ago, and their purpose at the time was to show approximate viewership analytics.They have not been updated to be in line with industry standards, including MRC viewability metrics that have influenced Xâs own standard viewability guidelines.As X and Periscope apps have been updated, itâs also likely that the Periscope metrics have become even more approximate, rather than more exact.In comparison, X platform metrics are continually analyzed and scrutizined to ensure viewership metric thresholds do not change over time.Normalized and filtered data When viewing your broadcast analytics in Producer in Media Studio, you will see a small note that says âit could take up to 3 hours for final viewership numbers to be published.â This is because all viewability metrics shown in Media Studio go through spam and normalization filters, ensuring more trustworthy data.It is possible that initially you may see slightly higher numbers across your broadcast metrics, then lower numbers later; this is because of the filters, and 3 hours is the approximate time it takes to ensure the data is correct.There are no spam and normalization filters for Periscope data, so you may see much higher Periscope metrics for your broadcasts.When trying to understand how well my broadcast performed, should I look at analytics in Producer in Media Studio or Periscope? We recommend focusing on the analytics found in Producer in Media Studio because of the many reasons highlighted in the question above.If you do look at Periscope data, it should be viewed as approximate data only, and should not be compared to, or aggregated with, data from Producer in Media Studio. What is the viewership number shown on the broadcast player on X, and why does it not match the broadcast analytics found in Producer in Media Studio? Across the various X platforms we show broadcast metrics directly within posts with broadcasts.When a broadcast is live, we show approximate live concurrent viewers as calculated by Periscope.When a broadcast is over and goes into the replay state, we show the approximate total viewers, again determined by Periscope calculations.These numbers are approximate, not exact, and thus may not match the normalized and filtered data found in Producer in Media Studio.Related Media Studio help Overview Library Analytics Producer LiveCut Monetize Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
