X's policy on media depicting deceased individuals or death Skip to main content Help Center Deceased individuals Overview March 2023 Sharing images or videos of a deceased individual can cause serious distress to the deceasedâs family and can also negatively impact the well-being of others who view this content.Out of respect for the deceased and those impacted by their death, as well as to decrease the impact of unintended exposure to graphic media, we may ask you to remove images and videos that depict the death of an identifiable person. If you want to request the deactivation of a deceased personâs account, immediate family members and those authorized to act on behalf of the estate can do so via our deactivation form. What is a violation of this policy? Under this policy, we may ask you to remove images or videos that were taken at the point of, immediately before, or after someoneâs death, if we receive a request from their family or an authorized representative.Sharing excessively gruesome images or videos, or sharing media depicting a deceased individual for sadistic purposes is also not permitted.
