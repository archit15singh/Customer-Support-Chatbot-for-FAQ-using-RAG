All purchases of Subscriptions are final and non- refundable, unless required by law.Refunds can only be issued by the App Store for iOS and Google Play Store for Android when a Subscriber submits a refund request.These requests are issued at their discretion.How do chargebacks impact a creatorâs payout? Where a purchase of a Subscription from X is subject to a chargeback, X will deduct the amount of the chargeback from the creatorâs total estimated revenue share earnings.X reserves the right to charge creators for fees X owes associated with chargebacks, but may choose not to do so.X may also recoup from you any fees associated with any chargebacks.How much do creators earn? Youâll be eligible to get paid up to 97%* of the revenue X has earned from the content you create, after in-app purchase fees, until you reach $50,000 in lifetime earnings from X across all X monetization products.*Note: After $50,000 in lifetime earnings, you can get paid up to 90% of the revenue X has earned after in-app purchase fees.Read our Subscriptions Creator Terms for more on the revenue share and what terms and conditions apply.Sample revenue breakdown** **for demonstration purposes only A creator is based in the United States, and their Subscriptions cost is $5.00.Someone from the United States signs up to access the creatorâs Subscriptions account (available on iOS and Android only at this time), paying X in USD.This creator hasn't yet reached $50,000 in lifetime earnings from X across Xâs monetization products.$5.00 - Subscriptions cost $1.50 - Appleâs in-app purchase fee (currently, 30% of Subscriptions cost under Apple's terms, subject to change by Apple) $0.10 - Xâs minimum share of the revenue $3.40 - Creator is eligible to get paid up to this amount by X How do creators get paid by X?

Why havenât I received a payout that was processed? Typically, it takes 3-5 business days for funds to appear in your bank account.In some cases, it can take up to 10 business days.Note: If it's been more than 10 days since your payout has been listed as processed, navigate to Get support from the Monetization option on the sidebar menu.Please include your X username (or âhandleâ) and we will investigate the payout further.What if I donât meet the $50 minimum payout requirement? No revenue share payment will be owed to you unless we have first recorded and attributed to your content an amount to meet the minimum payment amount of $50.If you donât meet the $50 threshold, the unpaid amount simply rolls over into the next month until the threshold has been met or exceeded.Why can't I request a payment if Iâve met the $50 minimum? Your request to get paid by X may not be processed if there is an information mismatch in your account with our payout provider.You may need to re-add your bank account details (or debit card) to your payout provider.For US tax filing, will I receive a Form 1099?
