X account notices and what they mean - suspensions and more Skip to main content Help Center Notices on X and what they mean We may sometimes add a notice to an account or post to give you more context on the actions our systems or teams may take.In some instances, this is because the behavior violates the X Rules.Other times, it may be in response to a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity in a given country.Below is a range of the notices you may come across when viewing an account or post. Notices on posts Our systems and teams may add notices on posts to give you more context or notice before you click through.A few of the times when we may add notices on posts include: Placing a post behind an interstitial: We may place some forms of sensitive media like adult content or graphic violence behind an interstitial advising viewers to be aware that they will see sensitive media if they click through.( Note : you cannot click through on X for iOS.) This allows us to identify potentially sensitive content that some people may not wish to see.Learn more about how to control whether you see sensitive media. Age Restricted Content: We restrict viewers who are under 18, or who do not include a birth date on their profile, from viewing adult content. You can learn how to add a birth date to your profile, adjust birth date visibility settings (visibility of your birth date is defaulted to private if you update it after January 2022), and learn how X uses your age to show you more relevant content, including ads, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.People over 18 can opt-out of viewing sensitive media on X by updating their settings here. Placing a post in violation behind an interstitial: We may allow controversial content or behavior which may otherwise violate our rules to remain on our service because we believe there is a legitimate public interest in its availability.When this happens, we limit engagement with the post and add a notice to clarify that the post violates our rules, but we believe it should be left up to serve this purpose.You can read more on how we review posts that may be in the legitimate public interest. Notice for a removed post that violated the rules: If a post was found to be in violation of our rules, and has yet to be deleted by the person who posted it, we will hide it behind a notice.The account will remain locked until the post is removed. Labeling a post that may contain disputed or misleading information: If we determine a post contains misleading or disputed information that could lead to harm, we may add a label to the content to provide context.For posts containing media determined to have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, we may add a "Manipulated media" label. Tapping these labels may link to a X Moment or other trusted source to provide additional information.Learn more about our policy on synthetic and manipulated media and our approach to handling misleading information.Hiding a violating post while awaiting its removal: Once X takes an enforcement action and the person removes their post, another notice will be available for 14 days after to acknowledge its removal.Where this notice is available: The details page of the post in violation on X for iOS and Android, and X.com.The profile page of the account in violation on X for iOS and Android, and X.com. Where this notice is not available: Areas outside of profiles and post details pages, such as Home timeline, notifications, and search of any X client.Notice for a post from a suspended account: If an account was found to be in violation of our rules, any posts from that account will be hidden behind a notice. Withholding a post or account in a country: We may withhold access to certain content in a particular country if we receive a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity in that country.We also clearly indicate within the product when content has been withheld.Read more about country withheld content. Hiding a reported post: If youâve reported a post, we will hide it behind a notice and give you the choice on whether or not you want to view the content again. Hiding a post from a muted or blocked account: If you have muted or blocked an account(s) and their posts are shared by someone else, weâll hide the content behind an interstitial and give you the option to click through and view it.Additionally, if youâve muted keywords, weâll place posts that include those behind a notice.Read more about muting and blocking accounts. Posts with limited visibility: There are some instances when a post is unavailable to view, such as a post from an account you do not follow that has protected posts, if the account has blocked you, the post was deleted, or if the post is from a deactivated account. Notices on accounts In some cases, we may add notices to accounts because of their account settings, while we wait for the account owner to update their account so itâs in compliance with our rules, or if we detect unusual activity from it.Also, we take action at the account level if we determine that a person has violated the rules in a particularly egregious way, or has repeatedly violated them even after receiving notifications from us.Requiring media or profile edits: If an accountâs profile or media content is not compliant with our policies, we may make it temporarily unavailable and require that the violator edit the media or information in their profile to comply with our rules.We also explain which policy their profile or media content has violated. Verifying account ownership: To ensure that violators do not abuse the anonymity we offer and harass others on the platform, we may require the account owner to verify ownership with a phone number or email address.This also helps us identify violators who are operating multiple accounts for abusive purposes and take action on such accounts.Note that when an account has been locked pending completion of a challenge (such as being required to provide a phone number), it is removed from follower counts, Reposts, and likes until a phone number is provided. Deactivated accounts: Account owners have the ability to deactivate their account at any time.When an account owner deactivates their account, the page will be rendered as unavailable. Permanent suspension: This is our most severe enforcement action.Permanently suspending an account will remove it from view, and the violator will not be allowed to create new accounts.When we permanently suspend an account, we notify people that they have been suspended for abuse violations, and explain which policy or policies they have violated and which content was in violation.Violators can appeal permanent suspensions if they believe we made an error.They can do this through the platform interface or by filing a report.Upon appeal, if we find that a suspension is valid, we respond to the appeal with information on the policy that the account has violated.
