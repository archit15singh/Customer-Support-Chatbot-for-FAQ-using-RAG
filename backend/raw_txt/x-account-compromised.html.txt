Protect your account with simple precautions If your account has been compromised, take these additional precautions: Delete any unwanted posts that were posted while your account was compromised.Scan your computers for viruses and malware, especially if unauthorized account behaviors continue to be posted after you've changed the password.Install security patches for your operating system and applications.Always use a strong, new password you don't use elsewhere and would be difficult to guess.Consider using two-factor authentication.Instead of relying on just a password, login verification introduces a second check to make sure that you and only you can access your X account. It is a critical security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your account and significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.Do not share your login credentials with anyone as a best practice to minimize the risk of account compromise.You can find more information in our account security tips page. How do accounts become compromised? Accounts may become compromised if you've entrusted your username and password to a malicious third-party application or website, if your X account is vulnerable due to a weak password, if viruses or malware on your computer are collecting passwords, or if you're on a compromised network.Unexpected updates don't always mean that your account was compromised.Occasionally, a third-party application can have a bug that causes unexpected behavior.If you see strange behavior, changing your password and/or revoking connections will stop it, as the application will no longer have access to your account.It's best to take action as soon as possible if updates are appearing in your account that you did not post or approve.
