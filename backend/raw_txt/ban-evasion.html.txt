X's policy on ban evasion | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Ban evasion policy Overview October 2020 Our rules exist to help keep everyone using X safe and ensure they can participate freely in the public conversation.Therefore, we prohibit attempts to circumvent prior enforcement, including through the creation of new accounts. What is in violation of this policy? Under this policy we prohibit a range of behaviors: You canât circumvent permanent suspensions. If an account has been permanently suspended for severe violations of Our Rules , X reserves the right to also permanently suspend any other account we believe the same account holder or entity may be operating in violation of our earlier suspension, regardless of when the other account was created.You canât circumvent an X suspension, enforcement action, or anti-spam challenge. This includes any behavior intended to evade any X remediation, such as creating a new account or repurposing an already-existing account.You canât circumvent an X suspension by operating, or having someone else operate on your behalf, an account which represents your identity, persona, brand or business persona for a different purpose. You canât allow someone who has been permanently suspended from X to permanently take over or temporarily operate your account.You canât imitate a suspended account if the apparent intent is to replace a suspended account. Operating a parody, newsfeed, commentary, and fan account that does not function as a replacement of the suspended account is not in violation of the above, provided that the account follows the applicable requirements outlined in the policy. What happens if you violate this policy? The consequences for violating this policy depend on the type and severity of the violation and of the accountsâ previous history of violations. Circumventing an X enforcement action (such as a permanent suspension) by creating accounts or repurposing existing accounts to replace or mimic a suspended account is a violation of the ban evasion policy; it will result in permanent suspension at first detection. We may suspend any account that is being operated to circumvent an X enforcement action (such as a temporary account lock).Note that the account owner may in some circumstances be allowed back on X following a successful appeal; however, any account used for the purpose of circumventing X remediation will remain suspended. Additional resources If you believe that an account you own has been suspended or otherwise restricted in error, instead of creating a new account, we recommend that you appeal your account suspension by contacting our support team, and/or that you comply with completing required X challenge(s) if applicable.Learn more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
