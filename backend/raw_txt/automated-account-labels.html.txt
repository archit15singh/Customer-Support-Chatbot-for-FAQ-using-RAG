About Automated account labels Skip to main content Help Center About automated account labels Weâre launching a labeling feature that allows automated accounts to identify themselves so you can have a better X experience.FAQ Whatâs an automated account and why do they need labels? Automated accounts (often referred to as âbotsâ) perform programmed actions through the Twitter API.Examples of automated accounts you might see on Twitter include bots that help you find vaccine appointments and disaster early warning systems.When these accounts let you know theyâre automated, you get a better understanding of their purpose when youâre interacting with them.What are automated account labels? Automated labels provide transparency by helping you identify if an account is a bot or not.When an account displays the "automated" account label you know the account is not human-run. How do automated account labels work? Automated accounts are created and managed by other people on Twitter.Our Automation rules require these accounts to display labels and remain connected to a human-run account.When someone who manages an automated account sets that account to display the identifying automatic account label, it also connects their human-run account to let everyone know whoâs managing it.Where will I see the label? Once an account accepts the invitation to our test group, an automated account label will appear on their account profile under their profile name and handle.The label may also appear on their Tweets.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
