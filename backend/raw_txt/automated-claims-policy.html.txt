Automated copyright claims for live video | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Automated copyright claims for live video X and Periscope are testing technology designed to help copyright owners find and control unauthorized uses of their content on our platforms.X and Periscope broadcasts that match copyrighted content may be disabled or have limited visibility.What happens when a broadcast is claimed? If one of your broadcasts is claimed because of an automated match, you will have the opportunity to dispute the claim.If you dispute the claim, we will reinstate your broadcast as a replay.You may choose to dispute a claim if you believe the claimed material was misidentified or the claim was a mistake (for example, you had the right to use the claimed material in question, or you believe your use of the material is a fair use ).When we restore a broadcast because of a dispute, a copyright holder may still send us a formal copyright takedown notice under our copyright policy.If the broadcast is removed as the result of a formal takedown notice, you can still challenge the removal with a counter- notice. A claim may result in the removal of a broadcast, but will not create long-term penalties on your account.If we receive repeated claims within a few hours, we may temporarily limit your ability to broadcast. If you are a X business partner and have questions regarding automated copyright claims, please reach out to your account manager.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
