X's inactive account policy | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Inactive account policy What is X's inactive account policy? We encourage people to actively log in and use X when they register an account.To keep your account active, be sure to log in at least every 30 days.Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity. How does X determine inactivity? Inactivity is based on logging in.Please note that you may not be able to tell whether an account is currently inactive, as not all signs of account activity are publicly visible. What if a potentially inactive account is using my registered trademark as its username or account name? If you believe your trademark rights are being infringed and the account seems inactive, please see X's trademark policy for additional information. What if I have a request for a username from an account that looks inactive, but I don't have a registered trademark? We cannot release inactive usernames at this time.If a username you would like is being used by an account that seems inactive, you should consider selecting an available variation for your use on X.In general, adding numbers, underscores, or abbreviations can help you come up with an available username.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
