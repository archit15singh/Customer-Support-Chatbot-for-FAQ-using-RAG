Once you're approved to move forward as part of the Subscriptions program, you'll need to set up a confirmed account with Stripe, our payout provider. Stripe determines payout eligibility and methods based on a creatorâs location.When can I get a payout? No revenue share payments will be paid to you unless we have first recorded and attributed to your content an amount to meet the minimum payment amount of $50.If you don't meet the $50 threshold, the unpaid amount simply rolls over into the next month until the threshold has been met or exceeded.Please note that estimated revenue share earnings are adjusted when chargebacks are successfully processed.The earnings amount is also adjusted if Apple or Google issues a refund for a Subscription.When we make a revenue share payment to you, we will make such payment to you through the Payment Processor approximately 60 days following the end of the month in which we received the revenue for the Subscription.Typically payments are made within the first two weeks of the month.For example, payments for revenue in March will typically occur within the first two weeks of May.I've met the minimum payment amount.Why canât I request a payout?

When a purchase of a subscription from X is subject to a chargeback, weâll deduct the amount of the chargeback from the creatorâs total estimated revenue share earnings.X reserves the right to charge creators for fees X owes associated with chargebacks, but may choose not to do so.X may also recoup from you any fees associated with any chargebacks.My payout was processed.Why havenât I received the funds?
