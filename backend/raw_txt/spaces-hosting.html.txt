People on X for iOS and Android can start a Space.

Give your Space a name Once your Space starts, you can add context by giving it a descriptive name.Other people will be able to see the name, so you can help set the mood by choosing something that speaks to your topic. Make the most with your co-host Whether your plan is to tag team or if you simply want more support in running and moderating your Space, choose a co-host from your participants, listeners or speakers alike.Up to 2 people can become co-hosts in a Space in addition to the 11 speakers (including the host) at one time.If the co-host leaves the Space, they may lose their co-host status.A co-host can also remove their own co-host status to become a listener again.Hosts can transfer primary admin rights to another co-host.If the original host drops from the Space, the first co-host added will become the primary admin.Co-hosts can: Invite others to become speakers Manage speaker requests Remove participants from the Space (see Reporting someone in a Space ) Edit Space name (see Give your Space a name ) Manage pinned posts (see Sharing posts in Spaces ) Mute all speakers or an individual (see Reporting someone in a Space ) Co-hosts canât: Add or remove other co-hosts End the Space Promoting your Space Reach more of your audience by posting out the link to your Space once it starts.Tap on the share icon to Share via a post.You can also pin your post announcement to your profile for even more visibility. Scheduling a Space Scheduling your Space and posting it out to the community can stir interest and let people know to save the date.It also lets others Repost your Space details through a timeline card.Make sure your guests show up by scheduling a Space in advance and signing up for reminders.Hosts can schedule one Space at a time up to 14 days in advance.Hosts can still create impromptu Spaces in the meantime, but can only have max one upcoming scheduled Space.To schedule a Space, open up Spaces and tap Schedule for later.Pick the date and time youâd like to schedule your Space to go live.Guests can sign up for reminder notifications from a scheduled Space card in a post.When the host starts the scheduled Space, the interested guests get notified via push and in- app notifications. Sharing posts in Spaces As a host, co-host, or speaker, you can find any post on your timeline and tap the share button, then tap Share to Space.Once a post is added, everyone inside of the Space at that time will be able to see it.Anyone who joins the Space after a post has been added will see the post as well.Keep the momentum going and use posts as a way to facilitate the conversation.Hosts and speakers can pin a post to the top of the Space to provide more context on the topic theyâll be discussing.Maintain the flow by having curated posts queued up and ready to share.Use X Bookmarks to keep all of your favorite posts in one place.Learn more about using the Bookmarks feature.Sharing posts is a way to address the audience initially before the voice chat starts.It will give people a way to respond and react. Recording a Space For people who canât attend your live Space, just record it and let them play it back whenever they want.When creating a Space, toggle on Record Space.While recording, a recording symbol will appear at the top to indicate that the Space is being recorded by the host.Once the Space ends, you will see how many people attended the Space along with a link to share out via a post.Under Notifications, you can also View details to post the recording.Under host settings, you will have the option to choose where to start your replay with Edit start time.This allows you to cut out any dead air time that may occur at the beginning of a Space.If you choose to record your Space, once the live Space ends, your recording will be immediately and publicly available for anyone to listen to whenever they want.You can always delete a recording to make it no longer publicly available, via the more icon on the recording itself.Your recording will remain available after the live Space has ended.* As with live Spaces, X will retain audio copies of all Spaces for a limited time to review for spam and abuse.Co-hosts and speakers who enter a Space that is being recorded will see a recording symbol (REC).Listeners will also see the recording symbol, but they will not be visible in the recording.Recordings will show the host, co-host(s), and speakers from the Space. *Note: Hosts on iOS 9.15+ and Android 9.46+ will be able to record Spaces that last indefinitely.For hosts on older app versions, recording will only be available for 30 days. Using Twemojis Spaces currently has five Twemojis that anyone can use to express their feelings.From, âIs this your first time in Spaces?â to âShow of hands for anyone who found that hilarious!â Twemojis let people in a Space respond, agree, laugh and more, in real time.Whether itâs excitement or acknowledgement, Twemojis are helpful toward encouraging more interaction and participation with your audience.
