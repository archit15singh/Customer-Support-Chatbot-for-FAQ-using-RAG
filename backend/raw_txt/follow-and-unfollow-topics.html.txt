We want Topics on X to reflect the broader, lasting conversations people have about the events, people, and things they discuss.So we use machine learning to find related posts from these conversations.This could mean they post a lot about the Topic or interact a lot with posts about the Topic.From there, we find the posts that are most interesting to those people, using algorithms, keywords, and additional signals.Weâve implemented a number of protections to help keep conversations included in a Topic healthy and free from abuse â including working to not recommend posts for a Topic if the engagement is manipulated or spammy.How to follow a Topic From your Home timeline: Step 1 While scrolling through your Home timeline, we may suggest a Topic for you to follow.Step 2 Tap or click on the Follow button next to the suggested Topic to follow.From your Topics menu: Step 1 Go to the more icon and tap or click on Topics.Step 2 A popup with options will appear.Step 3 Tap or click on Topics.Step 4 If you are following any Topics, they will appear here.You can select to follow more by clicking the Follow button.Step 5 If you are not interested, you can select the button and those Topics will appear in the Not Interested category of Topics.You can always choose to follow these Topics if you change your mind.How to unfollow a Topic From your Home timeline: Step 1 In your Home timeline, navigate to a Tweet about a Topic youâre currently following.Step 2 Tap or click on the icon from the top of the Tweet and select Unfollow.
