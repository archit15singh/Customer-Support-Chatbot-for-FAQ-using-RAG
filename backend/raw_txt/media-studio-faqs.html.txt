Uploading media                         How to upload media to your library
Ensure youâre logged in and viewing  studio.X.com.Click the  Upload  button at
the top-right of the page.Select one or more media files from your computer.Once
your media has been selected, upload will start automatically.Tip: You may also
drag and drop files into Media Studio.Uploading media - FAQs       Can I upload
multiple files at the same time?     Yes.When selecting media to upload from
your computer, you can highlight multiple files to upload.Studio also has a
drag-and-drop functionality, allowing you to upload files just by dragging the
icons from your desktop or file manager to your Media Studio library.     Why
canât I select.mov files for upload?     If you are unable to select an.mov
file via the file selection window, attempt to upload the file by dragging it
into your Media Studio Library.          Can I delete media from my library?
Yes, you can delete media from your library at any time.If you have previously
posted this media, people will see a playback error message.It is recommended
that you delete these posts to ensure people do not see this message.     Can I
filter the view of media within my library?     Currently we only support
filtering the library view by media type.     Uploading media - Common errors
and warnings         Error: âVideo too longâ     This error usually appears
when you uploading media.Check to ensure your video is under 2:20 in duration
(or 10 minutes, if you have been allowlisted for this feature by your X account
manager).     Error: âUpload failedâ         Video   This error can appear
for a few different issues: file size, resolution, encoding settings, or a
connection issue.First ensure that your video file is 1GB or smaller in
sizeâreducing the video bitrate of the file is the easiest solution for making
a smaller file size.Next, ensure the resolution and encoding settings of your
video are within our recommended specifications.Finally, if there is any packet
loss or connection failure at the time of upload, the entire process will fail
and need to be restarted.     Image and GIF   Ensure your file size, type, and
resolution are within the recommended specifications.          Processing: Stuck
at 5%     It could take up to 30 minutes for your media file to complete
processing.If the system cannot process the file within that timeframe, the
upload will fail and the âUpload failedâ error message will appear.This
happens most often with.mov files.If possible, re-export files as.mp4, which
should allow for overall faster upload and processing time.Metadata and content
settings                         How to modify media metadata
Click on the media you wish to modify within your Media Studio library.Click the
Settings  tab.You can update the following types of metadata (all optional):
Title  â updates the title field shown on some X platforms.Description  â
updates the description field shown on some X platforms.Call to action  â adds
a clickable/tappable URL to the video player shown on some X platforms.Embedded
post playback  â determines whether or not the video will play when a post
with your video is embedded on a third-party website, ensuring that users must
view the video on X.Video Downloads  â determines whether or not the video can
be downloaded by other users on the platform.By default, videos uploaded in
Media Studio are not downloadable on the platform unless the  Allow video to be
downloaded  has been turned on.Open  Content Restrictions  if you need to enable
video geo-restrictions:   Include.Exclude.Metadata and content settings - FAQs
How do I save any updates I make within Studio?     There is no save button
within Studio â all changes and updates are automatically saved.     Can I
edit the media Iâve uploaded to Media Studio?       No, Media Studio does not
currently have editing capabilities for any uploaded media.Clips created via
LiveCut can be edited within LiveCut, however this will create a copy of the
media and you would need to set any necessary metadata for the new version. 
    Does the filename appear anywhere on X?     No, the filename field in Media
Studio is not shown anywhere publicly.     Where is the title and description of
my video shown on X?       Once posted, the title and description of your video
will appear on the post details page under the video player.It will not appear
when the post is viewed on the timeline.     Can I change thumbnails of my
uploaded videos?     Yes.Click on a video within your library to see the Select
thumbnail button.You can either select a frame from the video itself, or upload
an image file from your local computer.If uploading a custom thumbnail file from
your computer, please ensure its aspect ratio is the same as your video
content.Using a custom thumbnail that is a different size can cause issues with
playback on X.     Can I upload a custom image thumbnail for a video?
Yes.Click on an uploaded video within your library and then click the âChange
thumbnailâ button.Here you have the option to either choose a frame from
within the video or upload a custom image from your computer.This feature is not
available on Safari.     What is the âHow would you describe your video?â
field? How is that category used on X?     This field is only required and used
for videos being monetized in the Amplify Pre-roll program as a way to match
your content with relevant advertisers.     When the field is used for non-
monetized, organic videos, the set category is neither used nor shown on X.  
What are content restrictions? What are geo-restrictions?         Enabling
content restrictions on a video allows the viewing of the video to be limited to
viewers in specified countries.Restrictions are set by either Including a list
of countries allowed to view, or Excluding a list of countries not allowed to
view the video.Keep in mind that there may be a delay when updating restrictions
on a video that has already been posted (approximately one to two minutes).  
Can I add a geo-restricted piece of media to a thread?     Adding to threads
from within Media Studio is not yet available, but here is a workaround.  
post out the geo-restricted video from Media Studio in its own post (this post
could be made to be âPromoted onlyâ so that it will not be publicly viewable
via your profile).On X, create a reply within the thread and paste the URL of
the geo-restricted video post and append /video/1 to the end of the URL, that
would look like this: X.com/handle/postid/video/1          post and media
analytics will be available via the post Analytics Dashboard and/or the Video
Analytics Dashboard (both found at  analytics.x.com ).Am I able to modify any
video metadata after posting?     Modifications to geo-restrictions and
subtitles settings will be applied to all posts in which the media is shared on
X, even retroactively.However, title, description, category, call-to-action, and
embedding settings cannot be changed for an existing post -- any changes made to
these settings will be reflected in any new posts created with that media.  
Metadata and content settings - Common errors and warnings         Error: 'valid
URL must be providedâ     This error message occurs when adding a call-to-
action URL.Check for any invalid special characters in your URL, like vertical
bars, spaces, or quotation marks.     Error: 'Error refreshing media'     This
can happen if too many changes are made to metadata too quickly, causing Media
Studio to have issues saving all of the changes at once.Refresh your browser
window and attempt to make the changes again.Posting and scheduling Posts

No, this feature is not supported in Media Studio today.     Can I schedule more
than one post at a time?     You can only schedule one post at a time per
account.If you have access to multiple accounts, you can schedule a post to be
sent from any or all of those accounts at the same time with the same post
content.          Can I edit a scheduled post?     No, it is not possible to
edit a scheduled post in Media Studio.If you need to make a change, delete the
scheduled post and create a new one.   Scheduled posts can be modified on X.com,
however this will create a new, lower-quality copy of the media and lose
associated metadata set within Media Studio.If you have access to a X Ads
account, you can edit scheduled posts from that dashboard under Creatives â>
posts page.     How do I delete a scheduled post created via Media Studio?
Click on the Schedule button within the top navigation bar.In this view, all of
your scheduled posts will appear.Click the delete icon   next to any scheduled
posts you would like to delete.For posts that have already been posted to X, you

Sharing username search field?     Most commonly this occurs when the handle was
just created; wait 24 hours and try searching for the username again.If after

functionality happens via a typeahead function, this means that you can only
enter one username at a time.There is no way to automatically share media across
multiple usernames or copy/paste a bulk action.          Does the username
getting access to shared media receive any notification, email, or alert?  
No, users that have media shared with them will not receive a notification.They
will see the media in their Shared Library when they next visit or refresh the
page.After sharing a piece of media, a âShared linkâ will appear at the
bottom of the âSharingâ tab.You can send this link to the recipient, which
will prompt them to log into Media Studio with their X account that you shared
with in order to create a post with the shared media.Subtitles

media within your Media Studio library.Click the  Subtitles  tab.Select the
language of the SRT file.Click  Upload.Select a subtitle file from your
computer.Subtitles - FAQs       How to format an.SRT subtitle file       Follow

00:00:08,000   Hey, how's it going?   2   00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,000   What's
up, how are you?   3   00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,000   Doing well, thanks!    
Can I upload multiple subtitles per video?     Currently we only support one
subtitle file uploaded per video.     Where do subtitles show on X?       When a
video with subtitles is viewed on X, the subtitles will appear as an overlay
atop the video when the subtitles language matches the language set on the
viewing userâs device (on desktop, the subtitles language is matched to the
userâs X language settings).If the subtitles language is not the same as the
language of the user, subtitles will not appear.     By default, subtitles
appear when the videoâs sound is not playing, and will be hidden when sound is
playing.Some users may have subtitles enabled within their deviceâs
accessibility settingsâif this is the case, then subtitles will always show,
regardless of whether audio is on or if full-screen view is in use.     I
uploaded a subtitle, why doesnât appear in the preview player in Media Studio?
Correct.Subtitle files will only be shown once posted.Subtitles - Common errors
and warnings       Error: âThere was a problem uploading your subtitle (.srt)
fileâ     This means that there is likely an issue with the formatting of the
file.Letâs use this below subtitle with incorrect formatting as an example:
22   0:00:36.801--> 0:00:42.239   Hey, how's it going?   21   00:00:40,161 -->
00:00:42,239   What's up, how are you?   Open the.SRT subtitle using your
preferred text editing application and look for the following:        Chronology
    Any end time needs to be before the next start time.All subtitle headers
need to be in chronological order.     Spaces         Remove any unnecessary
spaces that appear before a time code.Ensure there is one space before and one
space after the "â>" in each time code.     Timestamp         A colon â:â
is required between the hours, minutes, and seconds.     A comma â,â is
required between seconds and milliseconds.     Digits         Time codes must
have double digits in all values for hours, minutes, and seconds.Milliseconds
need to have three digits.                                    Share this article
