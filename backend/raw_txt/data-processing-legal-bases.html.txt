Legitimate interests analysis summary â advertising we show you on X based on data you provide or we collect on X, or on other websites or mobile apps based on information collected there X uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives during the individualâs use of X (as described in Xâs Privacy Policy ) to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees on the platform.When X shows ads in other apps or websites, X uses information from that app or website to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees.This enables X to give individuals a better product experience that is more in line with their interests and the content they find most meaningful and relevant to them, and to provide more valuable advertising offerings that generate revenue to support and improve its services.Without this processing, Xâs advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Xâs business customers.To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X offers individuals a variety of controls over the ads they see on X. Individuals may block or mute specific advertisers if they do not wish to see ads from those advertisers, report bad or offensive ads, and flag ads that they do not like.In addition, every ad on X provides a dropdown âWhy am I seeing this ad?â option to let the individual see the basis on which the ad was shown to them, such as inferred age, gender, and interests.The individual may then modify that information in Your X data to affect future ads that they see.This service is available both to individuals with a X account and those who do not have an account or are logged out of X. Legitimate interests analysis summary â Measuring the effectiveness of advertising we show you X uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Xâs Privacy Policy ) to measure the effectiveness of the advertising X shows to individuals. This enables X to give advertisers a means of better understanding the performance of the advertising they purchase through X.Such advertising measurement offerings are a critical component of Xâs business because they enable advertisers to make informed decisions about what kinds of advertisements they should run, when they should run them, what kinds of content they should include, and the audiences they should try to reach.Without this processing, Xâs advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Xâs business customers.To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X primarily offers advertising measurement through data processor partnerships that generate reports for advertisers about key performance indicators of their X advertising campaigns.These data processors are subject to a number of contractual restrictions around how they are permitted to process data received from X, including that they are prohibited from sharing with third parties that are not acting as data processors any X data that by itself can be used to identify an individual. X also shares non-public personal information with advertisers that are not acting as data processors in order to enable those advertisers to measure their own advertising.As described above, X treats such partnerships as consent-based data processing and X customers located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom must have their âAllow additional information sharing with business partnersâ setting enabled in order for X and its data processors to share their non-public personal information with non-data-processors in such circumstances. Legitimate interests analysis summary â enabling advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign X uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Xâs Privacy Policy ) to enable advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign. This enables X to give advertisers a way to avoid showing their ads to people who are irrelevant to the goals of their campaigns (e.g., people who have already installed the advertiserâs game).This feature is a critical component of Xâs business because it helps X serve fewer irrelevant ads and enables X advertisers to effectively run advertising campaigns at scale while reducing bad user experiences with irrelevant ads and wasting money serving ads to users who have already taken the action being advertised.Without this processing, Xâs advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to Xâs business customers, some of whom would not run advertising campaigns on X at all.To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X implements technical measures, contracts, and policies to disclose this processing, separate out the personal data processed only for this purpose, minimize the amount and type of personal data processed for this purpose, and avoid processing of personal data based on categories that may be sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Legitimate interests analysis summary â non-service related notifications about your X activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other X product features X uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in Xâs Privacy Policy ) to send non-service related notifications to X account holders about their X activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other X product features.This enables X to provide information that individuals may find valuable or useful, such as posts or Direct Messages directed to the individual, analytics about content the individual authored, and new product features.Without these notifications, people would have a harder time learning of content relevant to them on X, would receive less feedback about their content on X, and would potentially miss out on conversations with others on X.To safeguard the rights of those who use our services, each non-service related email notification contains an opt out link that enables the individual to disable any or all such notifications.An individual can similarly update his or her preferences at any time while logged into X.com or our mobile apps.For individuals in the European Union, an EFTA State, and the United Kingdom, control is also provided during the registration process in which the individualâs email address is first collected.
