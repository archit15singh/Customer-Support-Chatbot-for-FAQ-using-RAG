Understanding age screening and how it works | X Help Skip to main content Help Center About age screening on X What is age screening? Age screening is a way for brands and others to determine online whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, in a way that is consistent with relevant industry or legal guidelines.This makes it easier for advertisers and others with content not suitable for minors (e.g.alcohol advertisers) to advertise on X. How does age screening work on X? X has developed a solution for brands that requires new X followers to enter their birth date before being permitted to follow their account.If you have already entered your date of birth on your profile page, it will be detected and you will be able to immediately follow the account.If you have not already entered your date of birth on your profile page, we will ask you to enter your date of birth on your profile page settings. The feature was designed to help brands determine whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, while at the same time providing an easy and secure way for you to follow accounts that you would otherwise be blocked from following.X advertisers who use the solution will not have access to your birthdate or age unless your birthday visibility settings permit them to view this information on your profile, but will know when youâve entered an age thatâs above their indicated threshold.This feature is free, and available to a select number of our advertising partners. Does age screening comply with applicable guidelines and best practices? Compliance with specific industry guidelines around age screening and age-based targeting is the responsibility of the brand.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
