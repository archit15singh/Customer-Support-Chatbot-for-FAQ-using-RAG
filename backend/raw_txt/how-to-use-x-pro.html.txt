specific word or phrase, or posts with photos.   The location filter allows you
to filter for posts geotagged in specific locations.The user filter allows you
to filter posts within a specific column written by a certain author and those
they mention.   The engagement filter allows you to filter posts with a minimum
number of Reposts, likes or replies.The alert filter allows you to enable pop-
ups or sounds for a particular column.Note:  If you create a search column, you
can also filter results by location, date, and engagement.The location filter
