X's sensitive media policy | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Sensitive media policy Overview March 2023 You may not post media that is graphic or share violent or adult nudity and sexual behavior within live video or in profile header, List banner images, or Community cover photos.Media depicting excessively gory content, sexual violence and/or assault, bestiality or necrophilia is also not permitted.People use X to show whatâs happening in the world, often sharing images and videos as part of the conversation.Sometimes, this media can depict sensitive topics, including graphic content and adult nudity and sexual behavior.We recognize that some people may not want to be exposed to sensitive content, which is why we balance allowing people to share this type of media with helping people who want to avoid it to do so. For this reason, you canât include graphic content or adult nudity and sexual behavior within areas that are highly visible on X, including in live video, profile, header, List banner images, or Community cover photos.If you share this content on X, you need to mark your account as sensitive.Doing so places images and videos behind an interstitial (or warning message), that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed.Using this feature means that people who donât want to see sensitive media can avoid it, or make an informed decision before they choose to view it. We also restrict specific sensitive media, such as adult nudity and sexual behavior, for viewers who are under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile.Learn more about age restricted content here.Under this policy, there are also some types of sensitive media content that we donât allow at all, because they have the potential to normalize violence and cause distress to those who view them. We group sensitive media content into the following categories: Graphic content Graphic content is any media that depicts death, violence, medical procedures, or serious physical injury in graphic detail.Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: violent crimes or accidents; physical fights; physical child abuse; bodily fluids including blood, feces, semen etc.; serious physical harm, including visible wounds; and severely injured or mutilated animals. Note: exceptions may be made for documentary or educational content. Adult nudity and sexual behavior Adult nudity and sexual behavior is any consensually produced and distributed media that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal.Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts (excluding content related to breastfeeding); simulated sexual acts; and sexual intercourse or other sexual acts â this also applies to cartoons, hentai, or anime involving humans or depictions of animals with human-like features. Note: exceptions may be made for artistic, medical, health, or educational content. For content that was created or distributed without the consent of those featured, please refer to our non- consensual nudity policy. Violent sexual conduct Violent sexual conduct is any media that depicts violence, whether real or simulated, in association with sexual acts.Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: rape and other forms of violent sexual assault, or sexual acts that occur without the consent of participants, including a simulated lack of consent; and sexualized violence â inflicting physical harm on an individual within an intimate setting, where it is not immediately obvious if those involved have consented to take part. Bestiality and necrophilia Bestiality is any media that depicts sexual acts between a human and an animal.Necrophilia is any media that depicts sexuals acts between a living human and a human corpse. Gratuitous gore Gratuitous gore is any media that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content related to death, violence or severe physical harm, or graphic content that is shared for sadistic purposes.Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: dismembered or mutilated humans; charred or burned human remains; exposed internal organs or bones; and animal torture or killing. Note: exceptions may be made for religious sacrifice, food preparation or processing, and hunting. For deceased individuals, please refer to our Deceased individuals policy.
