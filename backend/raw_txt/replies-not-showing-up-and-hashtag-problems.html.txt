Help with hashtags and replies Skip to main content Help Center Help with hashtags and replies Some people report difficulty using a hashtag in their posts, or that posts sent as replies aren't working as expected.Weâve listed some possible causes and how to fix them.My mentions aren't displaying properly Is there a symbol after the username? If you write @XSupport.123 , your message will be sent to the account @XSupport , not @XSupport123.Is there text or a symbol preceding the @ symbol? If you write.@XSupport or ?@XSupport , it will appear as a regular post, meaning all of your followers will see it in their timeline, rather than just you, the intended recipient and those who follow both of you.Is there a letter preceding the @ symbol? If you write 123@XSupport or word@XSupport , @XSupport will not receive your post.Mentions will not work with letters or numbers in front of the @ symbol.The @ symbol must be at the beginning of a post or it must have a space directly in front of it in order for the mention to work.Are your posts protected? If your posts are protected, the person you're trying to mention has to be one of your approved followers in order to see your post.For example, if @XSupport has protected posts, @X won't be able to see their posts unless @X follows that account. My replies aren't appearing in the conversation Are you looking for your replies? If youâre not seeing your reply below a post, it may be because of an outstanding technical capacity limitation.When there are an overwhelming volume of replies to a post, our platform is unable to show all of these replies.However, if your reply is showing up in your timeline, the post author can, in most cases, view your reply in their Notifications. My hashtags aren't working Is there a symbol or punctuation in or after the hashtag? If you write #itâsfun , your message will be categorized under #it.Punctuation marks ( ,.; ' ? ! etc.) will end your hashtag wherever punctuation occurs.Is there a letter preceding the hashtag symbol? If you write 123#sofun or word#sofun , your posts will not show in searches for the hashtag #sofun.Hashtags will not work with letters or numbers in front of the # symbol.The # symbol must have a space directly in front of it in order for it to show correctly in searches.Is the hashtag made up entirely of numbers? If you write #1 or #123 the hashtag will not be hyperlinked and is therefore not searchable.However, if you include letters following the numbers in the hashtag, for example, #123go , then the hashtag will work correctly.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
