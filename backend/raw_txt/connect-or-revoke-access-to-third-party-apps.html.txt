Available tools                                              Third-party apps
are applications built on the X platform by external developers, and are not
owned or operated by X.When you connect a third-party app to your X account, you
are granting that app access to use your account.Depending on its permissions,
an authorized app may be able to obtain information from and use your account in
various ways, such as reading your posts, seeing who you follow, updating your
profile, posting posts on your behalf, accessing your Direct Messages, or seeing
your email address.You can learn more about the specific access in the  App
permissions   section below.Addiontally you can choose to  log out of your
active X sessions.               Note:  You should be cautious before giving any
third-party app access to your account.If youâre not comfortable with granting
an app access to your account, simply click âcancelâ on the authorization
page to decline the appâs access.We also suggest you regularly review third-
party apps which have access to use your account to confirm that you still want
to give them access.You can review and revoke access for apps by visiting the
Apps and sessions  section of your account settings.Logging out of active X
sessions                                                        How to log out
of your active X sessions                      Sign in to your account.From your
  Settings and privacy , go to the   Apps and sessions   section of your account
settings.Below   Sessions , all of the active login sessions connected to your
account will be displayed.You can see the location and time of login.If youâd
like to log out of any of the sessions listed, click the   Log out   button next
to the session, or click   Log out all other sessions   at the top of the list
to end all other sessions at once.Please note that while logging out of a
session will prevent further actions from that session such as posting, Liking,
and replying, it may not delete data (e.g., Direct Messages) that was previously
cached on the device while the session was active.App permissions
             App permissions     Third-party apps may request access to perform
different actions using your X account.OAuth 1.0a User Context   Apps using
OAuth 1.0a User Context may ask for the following permissions to access certain
information in your account and take certain actions:   Read   Apps with read
access to your X account will have the ability to:   Profile information: View
your profile information, such as your name, location, description, and profile
and header photos.Note that the email address associated with your X account and
your phone number are not considered profile information.An app will not be able
to view your email address unless you grant the app specific permission to do
so.   posts: View your posts (including details such as the number of times a
post has been viewed and the interactions others have with a post) and posts
from accounts you follow on your timeline, including any protected posts.  
Account settings: View your account settings, such as your preferred language
and time zone.   Other accounts: See who you follow, mute, and block.Lists: View
your Lists of X accounts.Collections: View your collections of posts.

following permissions:   Read and Write   Apps with read and write access to
your X account will have access to view your information as described in the
Read section above, and will also have the ability to:   Profile information:
Update your profile information for you.     posts: Post posts and media on your
behalf, delete posts for you, and engage with posts posted by others for you

view your information and take actions as described above in the Read and Write
sections, and will also have the ability to: send Direct Messages for you, view
Direct Messages youâve sent and received, and manage and delete your Direct
Messages.Remember that each communication participant has their own copy of the
communication â deletion of a Direct Message will remove it from your account,
not the accounts of the other participants to the communication.     Email

to view the email address associated with your X account.     X Ads   If you use

data as described above, create and manage your advertising data (such as media,
creatives, campaigns, and audiences) for you, and manage your account (such as
account name, industry type, account and user settings, etc.).         
Learn more about granting access to your X Ads account with  multi-user login. 
OAuth 2.0 User Context   OAuth 2.0 User Context enables a developer to set more
granular access for their app.Apps using OAuth 2.0 User Context may may ask for
permissions in the following categories:   Read   Read permissions define what
an app can see in your X account.For example, an app may ask permission to view
things like:   All the posts and Spaces you can view, including posts from
protected accounts.People who follow you and people you follow.Accounts you've
muted and blocked.You'll see a list of things an app is requesting permission to
view under "Things this App can view."   Write   Write permissions define what
actions an app can take on your behalf.For example, an app may ask permission to
do things like:   post and repost for you.Hide and unhide replies to your
posts.Follow and unfollow people for you.You'll see a list of things an app is
requesting permission to do on your behalf under "Things this App can do."  
   We do not share your X password with apps.Remember that when you authorize an
app to access your X account or take actions on your behalf, the app may use,
store, and share your information in accordance with its own business
practices.While app developers agree to abide by our rules and guidelines, we
strongly recommend that you review an appâs terms and privacy policy before
you authorize the app to access your account.Learn more about our rules and
guidelines for third-party app developers in our  Developer Policy. 
How to connect to a third-party app                                       Step 1
In the app you want to connect, find the button/link asking you to connect your
X account (usually " Connect to X ", " Sign in with X " or something
similar).Step 2                Depending on the app, you may be presented with a
consent dialog from X asking you to authorize the app to use your account or you
may be prompted to grant the app access to the X accounts on your iOS

the  Apps and sessions  section of your account settings.All of the apps
connected to your account will be displayed.You can see the specific permissions
that each app has to use your account listed under the app name and
description.If youâd like to disconnect an app from your account, click the
Revoke access  button next to the app or at the bottom of the page after
clicking the appâs name.If an app asks for your password to access your
account     If you wish to grant a third-party app access to your account, we
recommend that you only do so using Xâs OAuth method.OAuth is a secure
connection method and doesnât require you to give your X username and password
to the third party.You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give
your username and password to an app or website.When you give your username and
password to someone else, they can gain complete control of your account and can
lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.If you are
unsure about whether a login page for a third-party app is using OAuth, go
directly to X.com and enter your credentials there, and then navigate back to
the app.If the app is using OAuth, the app should not require you to enter your
username and password again.You can learn more about how to check that youâre
on X.com with our  account security tips.If you previously provided your
password to an app that you are now unsure about, revoke its access on the  Apps
and sessions  section of your account settings and  change your password.Note:
You should be especially wary of and never provide your username and password
to:   Websites claiming to help you âget more followers fast!â (see our
following rules and best practices  for more information).Apps which post
affiliate ads to your timeline.             If you suspect a bad app is still
connected to your account     Immediately revoke its access on the  Apps and
sessions  section of your account settings and  change your password.If you are
experiencing problems with an app, please read the  compromised accounts
article for more information.If youâre having issues with a third-party app
Because third-party apps are not owned and operated by X, we're not able to
troubleshoot them.Itâs best to reach out to the app developer for answers to
your questions or to let them know about a problem you're having with their
product.Available tools   Third-party tools created by developers add new
functionalities and can enhance your X experience.These tools are self-serve,
and many are free to use.You can learn more about some of the tools currently
available below.     Please note: Weâre early in our effort to make third-
party tools available and discoverable.Additionally, some tools are created by
Xâs internal development team.Although some of these tools are only available
to specific devices and operating systems, we hope to extend access across all
devices and operating systems.                      Tweet Tiles
Post Tiles                          X's internal development team is currently
experimenting with post Tiles, a way to attach customizable formats to a post. 
Right now, people on iOS and web may see and interact with post Tiles that
include text, images, videos, or other elements like a button from people in the
initial test group.These formats are designed to easily engage with content and
make your timeline more dynamic and visual.         When someone in our initial
test group posts a post Tile, people on iOS and web who are part of this
experiment will automatically see the post Tiles they post on the Home
timeline.Like post Cards, post Tiles render automatically when you paste a URL.
     Please note: Not all followers will automatically see the post Tiles, and
if you Repost a post Tile or share a post Tile URL, others might not be able to
see it.
