How to take a X break on X Skip to main content Help Center How to take a X break on X Post We all do it.We wake up and check X first thing.We lay in bed late at night and scroll through our timeline to make sure we donât miss what people are talking about and whatâs trending.Before you know it, you could be scrolling for what feels like hours. With so much happening in the world, all of the breaking news and voices on the platform can sometimes be a little overwhelming.We know the feeling of wanting to stay connected, yet needing to take a step back for your mental health.Luckily with X, we make it easy to take a "break" on X while on X. All you need to do is tailor your experience! Hereâs how: Topics Obsessed with certain celebrities, food, or gaming? Topics will make sure you see more of what you like throughout your timeline and in the Explore tab.You might already see some Topics we suggest to you based on your activity.Or, browse through our Topics selector for Topics on Topics on Topics.(Seriously, thereâs a lot, and weâre adding more and more.) Simply follow the ones youâre interested in and we'll take you to your X happy place with a personalized experience of relevant posts, events, and ads. Lists Build your own timeline with Lists.No, not like a shopping list, it's a lot more exciting than that.X Lists are curated groups of accounts that create a timeline of posts from those accounts added to the List.You can curate your own or follow someone elseâs.You can pin up to five Lists as timelines for easy scrolling access.All you need to do is swipe between them.Maybe you only want to scroll through a List of food accounts to bookmark some new recipes you want to try, or a List of people you know in real life only.You have the power to! So get curating and scroll through what inspires you. Autoplay settings Give your eyes and mind a break.Thereâs a lot of shared content on X.And while this makes us a go-to source for breaking news and what people are talking about in the world, it can also be a little overwhelming.Try turning off your autoplay settings.This simple step will stop videos from automatically playing.Youâll only see the video content if you choose to play it. Mute Mute is a go-to, classic X feature.Maybe you donât want to look through Topics or spend time curating Lists.Thatâs okay! Mute is simple, yet mighty.You can mute an account without unfollowing them if youâd like to avoid seeing their posts for a time.Or perhaps itâs certain content that youâd like to avoid on X.Thatâs easy! In addition to people, you can mute particular words, phrases, usernames, emojis, or hashtags.Plus, itâs easy to unmute from your settings at any time. Block Weâve all heard the X joke by now: âBlocked and reported.â Aside from this being cheeky X humor, itâs a simple directive on how to make your X experience better for you.When you need to, block an account to restrict them from following you, seeing your posts, and replying to your posts while logged in to X.And like mute, you can unblock from your settings if and when you want to. Protected posts Maybe you still want to be active on X, but not with everyone.By protecting your posts , you approve who follows you and sees your posts, while turning off X functions like repost and sharing your posts through DM. Direct Messages Do you want to enjoy X, but not so publicly? Share posts and talk about whatâs happening with a trusted X friend or group through your DMs.You can even share a fun GIF or two...or six.Subpost A Subpost is a post that allows a reference to a particular X user without directly mentioning them.X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
