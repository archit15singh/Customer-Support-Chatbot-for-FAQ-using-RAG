How to find available X handles or usernames Skip to main content Help Center Help with username registration The username I want is taken If you try to select a username (also known as a handle) and see that it has already been claimed, you will need to select a different one.Remember the following: You can list your real name in your profile to provide more information to your followers.Adding underscores before or after your desired username will help you claim a unique username on X.Example : if you would like the username @lindsay but it has been claimed, consider selecting a name like @lindsay_ or @_lindsay.I see an error message when I try to select my username, but I donât think itâs taken Here are the possible reasons why you would be unable to claim a username that seems available: Usernames containing the words X or Admin cannot be claimed.No account names can contain X or Admin unless they are official X accounts.Your username cannot be longer than 15 characters.Your name can be longer (50 characters) or shorter than 4 characters , but usernames are kept shorter for the sake of ease.A username can only contain alphanumeric characters (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9) with the exception of underscores , as noted above.Check to make sure your desired username doesn't contain any symbols, dashes, or spaces.The username may be claimed by a suspended or deactivated account.Suspended and deactivated usernames are not immediately available for use, so youâll need to select a different username. If you try view a suspended or deactivated profile by navigating to their profile, youâll see a message indicating suspension or deactivation.Can I get an inactive username?
