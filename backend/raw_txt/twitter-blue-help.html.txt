NFTs (short for Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital items, such as artwork, with proof of ownership thatâs stored on a blockchain (a digital database thatâs publicly accessible).After a temporary connection to your crypto wallet that allows you to set up an NFT as your profile picture, your digital asset displays in a special hexagon shape that identifies you as the owner of that NFT.Right now X only supports static image NFTs (JPEG, PNG) minted on the Ethereum blockchain (for example ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens).You can learn more about setting up an NFT profile picture here.What is a crypto wallet? Crypto wallets allow you to hold and transact (buy, sell, convert, send, etc.) with tokens owned by your public wallet address.This includes NFTs which are a type of token.A crypto wallet has one or more public addresses that are sometimes called âaccounts.â This address is public, so anyone who knows your wallet address will be able to see all of your walletâs transactions and holdings. To set up an NFT profile picture, youâll need to connect your X account to a crypto wallet that holds the NFT youâd like to select. X currently supports: Argent, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger Live, MetaMask, Rainbow, Trust Wallet Is an NFT profile picture safe? Setting up an NFT profile picture means people can associate your X account with your connected wallet's public crypto wallet address.This means your X account will be associated with your current and historical crypto wallet transactions and holdings, including all other NFTs in that wallet, because this information is all available on the public blockchain.A couple of things to be aware of when connecting a crypto wallet to your X account: X will never request funds from your crypto wallet.You should remain vigilant, and check all incoming requests to your wallet.Donât accept any transfer requests unless it is a known transaction to you. X will never request your private key or seed phrase, and you should never share your private keys or seed phrases anywhere, including on X.Although we wonât maintain an ongoing connection with your crypto wallet, we store your public address to ensure that it continues to hold the NFT you set as your profile picture.What happens if I sell or transfer the NFT in my profile picture? If you sell or transfer the NFT in your profile picture, the hexagon shape of the profile picture reverts to a circle.The image remains the same as the NFT you previously owned, but it wonât display any NFT details to suggest ownership.If youâd like to display another NFT, select from your NFTs in your wallet or link another wallet.What is the difference between the previous legacy blue checkmark and a checkmark obtained through an X Premium subscription? Previously, the blue checkmark indicated active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest that were independently verified based on certain requirements.Now the blue checkmark means the account has an active subscription to X Premium.Accounts that receive the blue checkmark as part of a X Premium subscription will not undergo review to confirm that they meet the active, notable and authentic criteria that was used in the previous process.What is X Verified Organizations? Verified Organizations is a subscription for businesses, governments and non-profits on X which comes with a gold checkmark, affiliation badges, premium support, impersonation defense and more features for organizations. What does the affiliation badge mean? Through Verified Organizations, businesses can affiliate other accounts with their account.Affiliated accounts receive a label with the image from the business's profile picture.What does the gold checkmark mean? What is the difference between the blue check and the gold check? The gold checkmark indicates that an account is an official organization on X through Verified Organizations.The blue checkmark indicates an account has subscribed to Premium, and may represent an individual or an organization.Learn more about profile labels and what they mean.What is the difference between an account that has a blue checkmark and an account that has an "Official" or other label? In addition to blue checkmarks, X may also apply visual identity signals like labels and badges on account profiles to provide more context about â and help distinguish â different types of accounts. The Official profile label may be applied to government accounts (institutional accounts, elected or appointed officials, and multilateral organizations)*, certain political organizations such as political parties, commercial companies including business partners, major brands, media outlets and publishers, and some other public figures.*State-affiliated media and government accounts that play a role as a geopolitical or official Government communication channel display a unique label. Learn more about profile labels and what they mean. Is dedicated support a premium feature of Premium?
