Protecting your personal information | X Help Skip to main content Help Center How to protect your personal information Control information you share with X settings Getting to know and controlling your settings is an important part of helping protect your information.Here are some articles containing steps you can take to secure your account: Control your experience Protect your posts Keep your account secure Consider what you post You are in control of how much information you share on X or any other website.Donât post information you consider to be private, and be thoughtful about when you want to publicly share your location.Be wary of any communication that asks for your private contact information, personal information, or passwords.If you are ever unsure before you post, we recommend you ask yourself the following questions: Who am I sharing this information with? How much and what type of information am I sharing? How many people can see the information I am sharing? Can I trust all the people that see this information? Not everyone has the same definition of what is considered private and what should be shared.If a friend or connection has posted information you prefer to be kept private, contact them and ask them to take down the content.Likewise, be considerate of others.If someone requests you remove information that you posted about them, please honor their request.This article explains how to delete a post. Report a violation If someone has posted your personal information (e.g.private phone number, home address, credit card information) and you would like it removed, please review our policy about private information posted on X.If the account is violating our policy, file a report and we will investigate.If the reported account is in violation, we will temporarily suspend the account until the information is removed.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
