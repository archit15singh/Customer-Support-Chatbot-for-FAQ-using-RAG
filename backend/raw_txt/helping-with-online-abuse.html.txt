How to help someone experiencing online abuse
Being the target of online abuse is not easy.If someone you know is being
affected by online abuse, here are some ways that might help, or make the
situation easier for them.Try to understand        Just because the abuse is
happening online, doesnât make it any less real.If a friend or loved one seeks
your help with an abusive online situation, listen to what they have to say and
take their situation seriously.          Encourage them to get help        While
itâs important to be there for them, encourage them to get professional help,
whether it be a counselor, therapist, lawyer, law enforcement, or other trusted
individual.If you know the individual online only, suggest they seek people
offline they can talk with.          Donât be a bystander        If you see
someone being abused online, donât look the other way.While it can be tempting
to retaliate against the abuser with hurtful words, this is usually what they
want you to do.Instead, reach out to your friend or family member with positive
words to remove the attention from the abuser.            Report content to us
