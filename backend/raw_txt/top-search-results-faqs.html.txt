When you search on twitter.com and on the Twitter for iOS and Android apps, you can filter your results by clicking or tapping Top , Latest , Accounts/People , Photos , or Videos (located at the top of your search results).Selecting Top shows Tweets you are likely to care about most first. Note : Top Tweets are selected through an algorithm, we do not manually curate search results. Why don't I see the Tweets I like in top Tweets? Top Tweets are the most relevant Tweets for your search.We determine relevance based on the popularity of a Tweet (e.g., when a lot of people are interacting with or sharing via Retweets and replies), the keywords it contains, and many other factors.If Tweets you love aren't showing up as top Tweets, it means they may not be the most relevant results for your search.You can tap Latest to see the most recently-posted Tweets matching your query.How can I make these top results go away, or come back?
