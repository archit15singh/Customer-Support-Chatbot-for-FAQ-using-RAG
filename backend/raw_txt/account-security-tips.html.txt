Read about fake X emails for more information about phishing through email. â¨â¨ We won't contact you asking for your password â¨â¨ X will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.We will never ask you to download something or sign-in to a non-X website.Never open an attachment or install any software from an email that claims to be from us; it's not.â¨ If we suspect your account has been phished or hacked, we may reset your password to prevent the hacker from misusing your account.In this case, we'll email you a X.com password reset link.â¨ If you forget your password, you can reset it via this link.New and suspicious login alerts If we detect a suspicious login or when you log in to your X account from a new device for the first time, we will send you a push notification within the X app, or via email as an extra layer of security for your account.Login alerts are only sent following new logins through X for iOS and Android, X.com, and mobile web.Through these alerts, you can verify that it was you who logged in from the device.If you did not log in from the device, you should follow the steps in the notification to secure your account, starting by changing your X password immediately.Please note that the location listed in the notification is an approximate location derived from the IP address you used to access X, and it may be different from your physical location.Note: If you log in to your X account from incognito browsers or browsers with cookies disabled, you will receive an alert each time.Email address update alerts Any time the email address associated with your X account is changed, we will send an email notification to the previously-used email address on your account.In the event your account is compromised, these alerts will help you take steps to regain control of your account. Evaluating links on X Many X users post links using URL shorteners, like bit.ly or TinyURL, to create unique, shortened links that are easier to share in posts.However, URL shorteners can obscure the end domain, making it difficult to tell where the link goes to.Some browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, have free plug-ins that will show you the extended URLs without you having to click on them: URL Expanders for Chrome URL Expanders for Firefox In general, please use caution when clicking on links.If you click on a link and find yourself unexpectedly on a page that resembles the X login page, do not enter your username and password.Instead, go to X.com and log in directly from the X homepage. Keep your computer and browser up-to-date and virus- free Keep your browser and operating system updated with the most current versions and patchesâpatches are often released to address particular security threats.Be sure to also scan your computer regularly for viruses, spyware, and adware.If you're using a public computer, make sure you sign out of X when you're done.Select third-party applications with care There are many third-party applications built on the X platform by external developers that you can use with your X account(s).However, you should be cautious before giving third-party applications access to your account.If you wish to grant a third- party application access to your account, we recommend that you only do so using Xâs OAuth method.OAuth is a secure connection method and doesnât require you to give your X username and password to the third party.You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give your username and password to an application or website, as third-party applications donât need your username and password to be granted access to your account via Oauth.When you give your username and password to someone else, they have complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.Learn about connecting or revoking third-party applications.We suggest you review third-party applications that have access to your account from time to time.You can revoke access for applications that you don't recognize or that are posting on your behalf by visiting the Applications tab in your account settings.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
